abstract = {Multilayer neural networks are among the most powerful models in machine learning, yet the fundamental reasons for this success defy mathematical understanding. Learning a neural network requires optimizing a nonconvex high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem that is usually attacked using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the former case, does this happen because local minima are absent or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the latter, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties? In this paper, we consider a simple case, namely two-layer neural networks, and prove that—in a suitable scaling limit—SGD dynamics is captured by a certain nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call distributional dynamics (DD). We then consider several specific examples and show how DD can be used to prove convergence of SGD to networks with nearly ideal generalization error. This description allows for “averaging out” some of the complexities of the landscape of neural networks and can be used to prove a general convergence result for noisy SGD.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called Entropy-SGD for training deep neural networks that is motivated by the local geometry of the energy landscape. Local extrema with low generalization error have a large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues. We leverage upon this observation to construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. Conceptually, our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD where we use Langevin dynamics in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights. We show that the new objective has a smoother energy landscape and show improved generalization over SGD using uniform stability, under certain assumptions. Our experiments on convolutional and recurrent neural networks demonstrate that Entropy-SGD compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generalization error and training time.},

abstract = {We examine the necessary and sufficient complexity of neural networks to approximate functions from different smoothness spaces under the restriction of encodable network weights. Based on an entropy argument, we start by proving lower bounds for the number of nonzero encodable weights for neural network approximation in Besov spaces, Sobolev spaces and more. These results are valid for all sufficiently smooth activation functions. Afterwards, we provide a unifying framework for the construction of approximate partitions of unity by neural networks with fairly general activation functions. This allows us to approximate localized Taylor polynomials by neural networks and make use of the Bramble–Hilbert Lemma. Based on our framework, we derive almost optimal upper bounds in higher-order Sobolev norms.

abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become a very powerful tool in the approximation of high-dimensional functions. Especially, deep ANNs, consisting of a large number of hidden layers, have been very successfully used in a series of practical relevant computational problems involving high-dimensional input data ranging from classification tasks in supervised learning to optimal decision problems in reinforcement learning. There are also a number of mathematical results in the scientific literature which study the approximation capacities of ANNs in the context of high-dimensional target functions. In particular, there are a series of mathematical results in the scientific literature which show that sufficiently deep ANNs have the capacity to overcome the curse of dimensionality in the approximation of certain target function classes in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating ANNs grows at most polynomially in the dimension {\$}d \backslashin \backslashmathbb{\{}N{\}}{\$} of the target functions under considerations. In the proofs of several of such high-dimensional approximation results it is crucial that the involved ANNs are sufficiently deep and consist a sufficiently large number of hidden layers which grows in the dimension of the considered target functions. It is the topic of this work to look a bit more detailed to the deepness of the involved ANNs in the approximation of high-dimensional target functions. In particular, the main result of this work proves that there exists a concretely specified sequence of functions which can be approximated without the curse of dimensionality by sufficiently deep ANNs but which cannot be approximated without the curse of dimensionality if the involved ANNs are shallow or not deep enough.},

abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

abstract = {Machine learning, and in particular neural network models, have revolutionized fields such as image, text, and speech recognition. Today, many important real-world applications in these areas are driven by neural networks. There are also growing applications in engineering, robotics, medicine, and finance. Despite their immense success in practice, there is limited mathematical understanding of neural networks. This paper illustrates how neural networks can be studied via stochastic analysis and develops approaches for addressing some of the technical challenges which arise. We analyze one-layer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (a) large network sizes and (b) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously prove that the empirical distribution of the neural network parameters converges to the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This result can be considered a law of large numbers for neural networks. In addition, a consequence of our analysis is that the trained parameters of the neural network asymptotically become independent, a property which is commonly called "propagation of chaos.},

Experimental results on modern, high-dimensional neural networks demonstrate that the algorithm converges faster than the benchmark stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Well-established PDE regularity results allow us to analyze the geometry of the relaxed energy landscape, confirming empirical evidence. Stochastic homogenization theory allows us to better understand the convergence of the algorithm.

abstract = {We study the necessary and sufficient complexity of ReLU neural networks – in terms of depth and number of weights – which is required for approximating classifier functions in an Lp-sense. As a model class, we consider the set E$\beta$(Rd) of possibly discontinuous piecewise C$\beta$ functions f:[−[Formula presented],[Formula presented]]d→R, where the different “smooth regions” of f are separated by C$\beta$ hypersurfaces. For given dimension d≥2, regularity $\beta${\textgreater}0, and accuracy $\epsilon${\textgreater}0, we construct artificial neural networks with ReLU activation function that approximate functions from E$\beta$(Rd) up to an L2 error of $\epsilon$. The constructed networks have a fixed number of layers, depending only on d and $\beta$ and they have O($\epsilon$−2(d−1)∕$\beta$) many nonzero weights, which we prove to be optimal. For the proof of optimality, we establish a lower bound on the description complexity of the class E$\beta$(Rd). By showing that a family of approximating neural networks gives rise to an encoder for E$\beta$(Rd), we then prove that one cannot approximate a general function f∈E$\beta$(Rd) using neural networks that are less complex than those produced by our construction. In addition to the optimality in terms of the number of weights, we show that in order to achieve this optimal approximation rate, one needs ReLU networks of a certain minimal depth. Precisely, for piecewise C$\beta$(Rd) functions, this minimal depth is given – up to a multiplicative constant – by $\beta$∕d. Up to a log factor, our constructed networks match this bound. This partly explains the benefits of depth for ReLU networks by showing that deep networks are necessary to achieve efficient approximation of (piecewise) smooth functions. Finally, we analyze approximation in high-dimensional spaces where the function f to be approximated can be factorized into a smooth dimension reducing feature map $\tau$ and classifier function g – defined on a low-dimensional feature space – as f=g∘$\tau$. We show that in this case the approximation rate depends only on the dimension of the feature space and not the input dimension.},

In the small step size regime and the presence of omnidirectional noise, our weak approximating diffusion process suggests the following dynamics for the SGD iteration starting from a local minimizer (resp.{\~{}}saddle point): it escapes in a number of iterations exponentially (resp.{\~{}}almost linearly) dependent on the inverse stepsize. The results are obtained using the theory for random perturbations of dynamical systems (theory of large deviations for local minimizers and theory of exiting for unstable stationary points). In addition, we discuss the effects of batch size for the deep neural networks, and we find that small batch size is helpful for SGD algorithms to escape unstable stationary points and sharp minimizers. Our theory indicates that one should increase the batch size at later stage for the SGD to be trapped in flat minimizers for better generalization.},

abstract = {The problem of characterizing the least expensive bond portfolio that enables one to meet his/her liability to pay C dollars K years from now is dealt with in this article. Bond prices are allowed to be either overpriced or underpriced at the purchase time, while at the sale time the bonds are suppose to be fairly priced. Assuming shifts in spot rates to occur instantly after the acquisition of a bond portfolio Z and to follow fairly general type of behavior described by the condition (2), we give both necessary and sufficient conditions for Z to solve the immunization problem above. Our model is general enough to cover situations with twists in the yield curve. Making use of the K-T conditions, we explain in remark 7 why we focus on search of an optimal portfolio in the class of barbell strategies. Finally, by means of the K-T conditions we find an optimal bond portfolio which solves the immunization problem. {\textcopyright} J.C. Baltzer AG, Science Publishers.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation function are proved to be able to express viscosity solutions of linear partial integrodifferental equations (PIDEs) on state spaces of possibly high dimension {\$}d{\$}. Admissible PIDEs comprise Kolmogorov equations for high-dimensional diffusion, advection, and for pure jump L$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}vy processes. We prove for such PIDEs arising from a class of jump-diffusions on {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}d{\$}, that for any compact {\$}K\backslashsubset \backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\^{}}d{\$}, there exist constants {\$}C,{\{}\backslashmathfrak{\{}p{\}}{\}},{\{}\backslashmathfrak{\{}q{\}}{\}}{\textgreater}0{\$} such that for every {\$}\backslashvarepsilon \backslashin (0,1]{\$} and for every {\$}d\backslashin \backslashmathbb{\{}N{\}}{\$} the nomalized (over {\$}K{\$}) DNN {\$}L{\^{}}2{\$}-expression error of viscosity solutions of the PIDE is of size {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$} with DNN size bounded by {\$}Cd{\^{}}{\{}\backslashmathfrak{\{}p{\}}{\}}\backslashvarepsilon{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashmathfrak{\{}q{\}}{\}}{\$}. In particular, the constant {\$}C{\textgreater}0{\$} is independent of {\$}d\backslashin \backslashmathbb{\{}N{\}}{\$} and of {\$}\backslashvarepsilon \backslashin (0,1]{\$} and depends only on the coefficients in the PIDE and the measure used to quantify the error. This establishes that ReLU DNNs can break the curse of dimensionality (CoD for short) for viscosity solutions of linear, possibly degenerate PIDEs corresponding to Markovian jump-diffusion processes. As a consequence of the employed techniques we also obtain that expectations of a large class of path-dependent functionals of the underlying jump-diffusion processes can be expressed without the CoD.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

abstract = {High-dimensional PDEs have been a longstanding computational challenge. We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to 200 dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a “Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)” since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs.},

To answer this question, we investigate 2 state-of-the-art NPI effectiveness models and propose 6 variants that make different structural assumptions. In particular, we investigate how well NPI effectiveness estimates generalise to unseen countries, and their sensitivity to unobserved factors. Models that account for noise in disease transmission compare favourably. We further evaluate how robust estimates are to different choices of epidemiological parameters and data. Focusing on models that assume transmission noise, we find that previously published results are remarkably robust across these variables. Finally, we mathematically ground the interpretation of NPI effectiveness estimates when certain common assumptions do not hold.},

abstract = {The basic reproduction number, R0, determines the rate of spread of a communicable disease and therefore gives fundamental information needed to plan public health interventions. Using mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and county-aggregates in the USA at the start of the epidemic. We show that most of the high among-county variance is explained by four factors (R2 = 0.70): the timing of outbreak, population size, population density, and spatial location. For predictions of future spread, population density and spatial location are important, and for the latter we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614 mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread. Finally, the high predictability of R0 allows extending estimates to all 3109 counties in the conterminous 48 states. The high variation of R0 argues for public health policies enacted at the county level for controlling COVID-19.},

abstract = {Since the emergence of the novel 2019 coronavirus pandemic in December 2019 (COVID-19), numerous modellers have used diverse techniques to assess the dynamics of transmission of the disease, predict its future course and determine the impact of different control measures. In this study, we conducted a global systematic literature review to summarize trends in the modelling techniques used for Covid-19 from January 1st, 2020 to November 30th, 2020. We further examined the accuracy and precision of predictions by comparing predicted and observed values for cumulative cases and deaths as well as uncertainties of these predictions. From an initial 4311 peer-reviewed articles and preprints found with our defined keywords, 242 were fully analysed. Most studies were done on Asian (78.93{\%}) and European (59.09{\%}) countries. Most of them used compartmental models (namely SIR and SEIR) (46.1{\%}) and statistical models (growth models and time series) (31.8{\%}) while few used artificial intelligence (6.7{\%}), Bayesian approach (4.7{\%}), Network models (2.3{\%}) and Agent-based models (1.3{\%}). For the number of cumulative cases, the ratio of the predicted over the observed values and the ratio of the amplitude of confidence interval (CI) or credibility interval (CrI) of predictions and the central value were on average larger than 1 indicating cases of inaccurate and imprecise predictions, and large variation across predictions. There was no clear difference among models used for these two ratios. In 75{\%} of predictions that provided CI or CrI, observed values fall within the 95{\%} CI or CrI of the cumulative cases predicted. Only 3.7{\%} of the studies predicted the cumulative number of deaths. For 70{\%} of the predictions, the ratio of predicted over observed cumulative deaths was less or close to 1. Also, the Bayesian model made predictions closer to reality than classical statistical models, although these differences are only suggestive due to the small number of predictions within our dataset (9 in total). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation (rho = - 0.56, p = 0.021) between this ratio and the length (in days) of the period covered by the modelling, suggesting that the longer the period covered by the model the likely more accurate the estimates tend to be. Our findings suggest that while predictions made by the different models are useful to understand the pandemic course and guide policy-making, some were relatively accurate and precise while other not.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: The outbreak of the current pandemic begun from the first individual of a 55-year old from Hubei province in China, the disease instigated by the new coronavirus spreading across the world. Scientists presently speculate this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, originated in a bat and by one way or another jumped to another creature, potentially the pangolin, which at that point gave it to people. The ailment is currently spreading between individuals with no animal delegate. Researchers are struggling to follow the infection back to where it started to become familiar with its spread. In the event that, for example, specialists can locate the soonest cases, they might have the option to distinguish the creature have where the infection hides. In March and April 2020, researchers detailed that this virus created normally. Coronavirus has been become of the serious global phenomena in the recent years and has negative effects in the entire world health and economy. The virus is believed to have been associated with a host animal which human contracted. Subsequently, human-to-human infection began. Through migration as humans have become complex with easy mobility the disease has traveled to the entire continent. Now, numerous scientist are going on in the hope of obtaining medication and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease and mortality of the disease. It is important that we obtain quantitative and qualitative information about the etiology of this disease which is crucial. Mathematical modeling is capable of providing qualitative information on many parameters that guides the decision making of health practitioners. In this work we focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). To find the role of factors/parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. Methods: To find the role of parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control mode. With the help of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian we minimize the density of contaminated stuff and infected human population. Results: We focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs). On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control model. The major NPIs are, STAY HOME, SANITIZER (wash hands), EARLY CASE DETECTION (PCR Test) and FACE MASK. These NPIs helps in mitigation and reducing the size of outbreak of the disease. Conclusion: We check the existence of the optimal solution for the system. At the end, Using matlab we produce numerical simulations for validation of results of control variables. The results demonstrate that if there is no control (variables/interventios), 900 out 1000 susceptible individuals may be infected (exposed) in very short period. As such a circumstances no agency fighting against COVID-19 could be successful due to its limited resources.},

abstract = {In the absence of effective vaccine/antiviral strategies for reducing the burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in India, the main focus has been on basic non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as nationwide lockdown (travel restrictions and the closure of schools, shopping malls, and worshipping and other gathering places), quarantining of exposed individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. In the present study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model incorporating quarantine and isolation compartments to (i) describe the current transmission patterns of COVID-19 in India, (ii) assess the impact of currently implemented NPIs, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with various scenarios of NPIs in India. For R 0 {\textless} 1, the system has a globally asymptotically stable disease free equilibrium, while for R 0 {\textgreater} 1, the system has one unstable disease free equilibrium and a unique locally stable endemic equilibrium. By using the method of least squares and the best fit curve, we estimate the model parameters to calibrate the model with daily new confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases in India for the period from May 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020. Our result shows that the implementation of an almost perfect isolation in India and 33.33{\%} increment in contact-tracing on June 26, 2020 may reduce the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India by around 53.8{\%} at the end of July 2020. Nationwide lockdown with high efficiency can diminish COVID-19 cases drastically, but combined NPIs may accomplish the strongest and most rapid impact on the spreading of COVID-19 in India.},

Indeed, more developed and wealthier areas became more isolated after government interventions and experienced a significantly lower burden of the pandemic. The heterogeneity of COVID- 19 impact raises important issues in the implementation of NPIs and highlights the challenges that communities affected by systemic health and social inequalities face adapting their behaviors behaviors during an epidemic. [p.1 Abstract]

Although other cases were rapidly confirmed all over the country, the urban area of the capital city, Santiago Metropolitan Region, quickly became the epicenter of the national epidemic. Indeed, as of September 1, 2020, about 70{\%} of the total cases in the nation have been reported in the comunas (i.e., municipalities) of Santiago, making it one of the largest urban COVID-19 outbreak in the world. The first set of non-
pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were put in place in mid- March, when schools were closed, public gatherings were banned, and passengers traveling from high-risk countries were mandated to self-isolate for 14 days. However, the adopted measures were not able to contain the contagion: after a sharp increase in cases, a full lockdown was instituted to the whole Metropolitan Region on May 153. [p.1]

abstract = {On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced that the COVID-19 disease developed into a global pandemic. In the present paper, we aimed at analysing how the implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) as well as climatic, social, and demographic variables affected the initial growth rate of COVID-19. In more detail, we aimed at identifying and assessing all the predictors in a whole picture of the COVID-19 outbreak and the effectiveness of the response of the countries to the pandemic. It can be expected, indeed, that there is a subtle and complex interplay among the various parameters. As such, we estimated the initial growth rate of COVID-19 for countries across the globe, and used a multiple linear regression model to study the association between the initial growth rate and NPI as well as pre-existing country characteristics (climatic, social and demographic variables measured before the current epidemic began). We obtained a mean initial growth rate of 0.120 (SD 0.076), in the range 0.023–0.315. Ten (8 pre-existing country characteristics and 2 NPI) out of 29 factors considered (21 pre-existing country characteristics and 8 NPI) were associated with the initial growth of COVID-19. Population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million, PM2.5 air pollution mean annual exposure, life expectancy, hospital beds available, urban population, Global Health Security detection index and restrictions on international movement had the most significant effects on the initial growth of COVID-19. Based on available data and the results we obtained, NPI put in place by governments around the world alone may not have had a significant impact on the initial growth of COVID-19. Only restrictions on international movements had a relative significance with respect to the initial growth rate, whereas demographic, climatic, and social variables seemed to play a greater role in the initial growth rate of COVID-19.},

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinitememory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the coefficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix. {\textcopyright} 1960 by ASME.},

@article{Davies2020,
abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children1–4. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21{\%} (95{\%} credible interval: 12–31{\%}) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69{\%} (57–82{\%}) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and suscep-tibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population struc-tures—such as many low-income countries—the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.},

"Third, differences in contact patterns among individuals of dif-
ferent ages, and setting-specific differences in age distribution, themselves affect the expected number of cases in each age group. Children tend to make more social contacts than adults[21] and hence, all else being equal, should contribute more to transmission than adults [22,23]. If the number of infections or cases depends strongly on
the role of children, countries with different age distributions could exhibit substantially different epidemic profiles and overall impact of COVID-19 epidemics." [p. 1]

This work has led to an accumulation of empirical evidence and new insights and has made substantial contributions toward the better understanding of travel behavior. However, practical applications of the approach in transportation planning and policy development have been scarce. Based on an analysis of the inherent characteristics of the activity-based approach, a review of recent (after the 1981 Oxford conference) developments, and a synthesis of the findings from past empirical studies, this study attempts to evaluate the contribution made by activity-based analyses and determine the reasons for the limited practical application. Recommendations are made for the future development of activity-based analysis as a science of travel behavior and as a tool in the practice of transportation planning and policy development. {\textcopyright} 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

@article{DeVisscher2020a,
abstract = {An epidemiological model for COVID-19 was developed and implemented in MATLAB/GNU Octave for use by public health practitioners, policy makers, and the general public. The model distinguishes four stages in the disease: infected, sick, seriously sick, and better. The model was preliminarily parameterized based on observations of the spread of the disease. The model assumes a case mortality rate of 1.5{\%}. Preliminary simulations with the model indicate that concepts such as “herd immunity” and containment (“flattening the curve”) are highly misleading in the context of this virus. Public policies based on these concepts are inadequate to protect the population. Only reducing the R0 of the virus below 1 is an effective strategy for maintaining the death burden of COVID-19 within the normal range of seasonal flu. The model is illustrated with the cases of Italy, France, and Iran and is able to describe the number of deaths as a function of time in all these cases although future projections tend to slightly overestimate the number of deaths when the analysis is made early on. The model can also be used to describe reopenings of the economy after a lockdown. The case mortality rate is still prone to large uncertainty, but modeling combined with an investigation of blood donations in The Netherlands imposes a lower limit of 1{\%}.},

From this aspect, the main objectives of this chapter are to study and present various wearable devices as part of the healthcare system toward combating the COIVD-19 pandemic. First, this work aims to review the different wearable devices and their usage to combat COVID-19 by patients, healthcare professional, frontliners, and global citizens. Hence, the major objectives of these wearable devices include device tracking, information sharing, and awareness creation to minimize the risk of coronavirus infection. Second, the chapter addresses a generalized framework toward the implementation of wearable devices to handle the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, this chapter aims to review monitoring techniques and various mechanisms used to analyze the data gathered from wearable devices in order to extract useful and critical information pertaining to users in the COVID-19 scenario. This chapter involves reviewing efficient techniques and algorithms that exist in literature for data analysis based on vital body signals from the wearable sensor devices. This effort enhances the patient/healthcare staff monitoring mechanism and helps to uncover preventive solutions in the COVID-19 scenario.},

@article{Chowdhury2020,
abstract = {To date, non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) have been the mainstay for controlling the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While NPIs are effective in preventing health systems overload, these long-term measures are likely to have significant adverse economic consequences. Therefore, many countries are currently considering to lift the NPIs—increasing the likelihood of disease resurgence. In this regard, dynamic NPIs, with intervals of relaxed social distancing, may provide a more suitable alternative. However, the ideal frequency and duration of intermittent NPIs, and the ideal “break” when interventions can be temporarily relaxed, remain uncertain, especially in resource-poor settings. We employed a multivariate prediction model, based on up-to-date transmission and clinical parameters, to simulate outbreak trajectories in 16 countries, from diverse regions and economic categories. In each country, we then modelled the impacts on intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths over an 18-month period for following scenarios: (1) no intervention, (2) consecutive cycles of mitigation measures followed by a relaxation period, and (3) consecutive cycles of suppression measures followed by a relaxation period. We defined these dynamic interventions based on reduction of the mean reproduction number during each cycle, assuming a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2 for no intervention, and subsequent effective reproduction numbers (R) of 0.8 and 0.5 for illustrative dynamic mitigation and suppression interventions, respectively. We found that dynamic cycles of 50-day mitigation followed by a 30-day relaxation reduced transmission, however, were unsuccessful in lowering ICU hospitalizations below manageable limits. By contrast, dynamic cycles of 50-day suppression followed by a 30-day relaxation kept the ICU demands below the national capacities. Additionally, we estimated that a significant number of new infections and deaths, especially in resource-poor countries, would be averted if these dynamic suppression measures were kept in place over an 18-month period. This multi-country analysis demonstrates that intermittent reductions of R below 1 through a potential combination of suppression interventions and relaxation can be an effective strategy for COVID-19 pandemic control. Such a “schedule” of social distancing might be particularly relevant to low-income countries, where a single, prolonged suppression intervention is unsustainable.

abstract = {Surprisingly little is known regarding the human mixing patterns relevant to the spread of close-contact infections, such as measles, influenza and meningococcal disease. This study aims to estimate the number of partnerships that individuals make, their stability and the degree to which mixing is assortative with respect to age. We defined four levels of putative at-risk events from casual (physical contact without conversation) to intimate (contact of a sexual nature), and asked university student volunteers to record details on those they contacted at these levels on three separate days. We found that intimate contacts are stable over short time periods whereas there was no evidence of repeat casual contacts with the same individuals. The contacts were increasingly assortative as intimacy increased. Such information will aid the development and parameterisation of models of close contact diseases, and may have direct use in outbreak investigations. {\textcopyright} 2006 Edmunds et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The Effective Reproduction Number Rt provides essential information for the management of an epidemic/pandemic. Projecting Rt into the future could further assist in the management process. This article proposes a methodology based on exposure scenarios to perform such a procedure. The method utilizes a compartmental model and its adequate parametrization; a way to determine suitable parameters for this model in M{\'{e}}xico's case is detailed. In conjunction with the compartmental model, the projection of Rt permits estimating unobserved variables, such as the size of the asymptomatic population, and projecting into the future other relevant variables, like the active hospitalizations, using scenarios. The uses of the proposed methodologies are exemplified by analyzing the pandemic in a Mexican state; the main quantities derived from the compartmental model, such as the active and total cases, are included in the analysis. This article also presents a national summary based on the methodologies to illustrate how these procedures could be further exploited. The supporting information includes an application of the proposed methods to a metropolitan area to show that it also works well at other demographic disaggregation levels. The procedures developed in this article shed light on how to develop an effective surveillance system when information is incomplete and can be applied in cases other than M{\'{e}}xico's.},

Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.

We estimate an 8 percent output loss in the first 5 months of the pandemic from the policy that was put in place, achieving a 56 percent reduction in the total number of infections. During this period, with an output loss to 10.5 percent of GDP, the infection rate would have decreased 92 percent, significantly delaying the spread of COVID and spike in infections. Our methodology applied to real data provided results that could be valuable in guiding policies in other lockdown situations in times of disaster, pandemics or social upheaval.},

abstract = {We propose a new method to estimate the time-varying effective (or instantaneous) reproduction number of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state variables (active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g., age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic peak.},

abstract = {We introduce an epidemic model with varying infectivity and general exposed and infectious periods, where the infectivity of each individual is a random function of the elapsed time since infection, those function being independent and identically distributed for the various individuals in the population. This approach models infection-age-dependent infectivity and extends the classical SIR and SEIR models. We focus on the infectivity process (total force of infection at each time) and prove a functional law of large number (FLLN). In the deterministic limit of this FLLN, the joint evolution of the mean infectivity and of the proportion of susceptible individuals is determined by a two-dimensional deterministic integral equation. From its solutions, we then obtain expressions for the evolution of the proportions of exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals. For the early phase, we study the stochastic model directly by using an approximate (non-Markovian) branching process and show that the epidemic grows at an exponential rate on the event of nonextinction, which matches the rate of growth derived from the deterministic linearized equations. We also use these equations to derive the expression for the basic reproduction number R0 during the early stage of an epidemic, in terms of the average individual infectivity function and the exponential rate of growth of the epidemic, and apply our results to the Covid-19 epidemic.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the inference regarding the effectiveness of the various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for COVID-19 obtained from different SIR models. Study design and setting: We explored two models developed by Imperial College that considered only NPIs without accounting for mobility (model 1) or only mobility (model 2), and a model accounting for the combination of mobility and NPIs (model 3). Imperial College applied models 1 and 2 to 11 European countries and to the USA, respectively. We applied these models to 14 European countries (original 11 plus another 3), over two different time horizons. Results: While model 1 found that lockdown was the most effective measure in the original 11 countries, model 2 showed that lockdown had little or no benefit as it was typically introduced at a point when the time-varying reproduction number was already very low. Model 3 found that the simple banning of public events was beneficial, while lockdown had no consistent impact. Based on Bayesian metrics, model 2 was better supported by the data than either model 1 or model 3 for both time horizons. Conclusion: Inferences on effects of NPIs are non-robust and highly sensitive to model specification. In the SIR modeling framework, the impacts of lockdown are uncertain and highly model-dependent.},

abstract = {In April 2020, we developed a COVID-19 transmission model used as part of RAND's web-based COVID-19 decision support tool that compares the effects of different nonpharmaceutical public health interventions (NPIs) on health and economic outcomes. An interdisciplinary approach informed the selection and use of multiple NPIs, combining quantitative modeling of the health/economic impacts of interventions with qualitative assessments of other important considerations (e.g., cost, ease of implementation, equity). We previously published a description of our approach as a RAND report describing how the epidemiological model, the economic model, and a systematic assessment of NPIs informed the web-tool. This paper provides further details of our model, describes extensions that we made to our model since April, presents sensitivity analyses, and analyzes periodic NPIs. Our findings suggest that there are opportunities to shape the tradeoffs between economic and health outcomes by carefully evaluating a more comprehensive range of reopening policies. We consider strategies that periodically switch between a base NPI level and a higher NPI level as our working example.},

We assume that infections occur both locally with a rate that depends on the patch as well as "from distance" from all the other patches. The exposed and infectious periods have general distributions, and are not affected by the possible migrations of the individuals. The migration processes in either of the three states are assumed to be Markovian, and independent of the exposed and infectious periods. We establish a functional law of large number (FLLN) and a function central limit theorem (FCLT) for the susceptible, exposed/latent, infectious and recovered processes. In the FLLN, the limit is determined by a set of Volterra integral equations. In the special case of deterministic exposed and infectious periods, the limit becomes a system of ODEs with delays. In the FCLT, the limit is given by a set of stochastic Volterra integral equations driven by a sum of independent Brownian motions and continuous Gaussian processes with an explicit covariance structure.},

abstract = {The emergence of COVID-19 in China, in December of 2019 led to a local epidemic that rapidly spread to multiple countries in the world, including Brazil. Nowadays, there is an accelerated search to understand the dynamics of the spread of the disease and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention measures. Given these special socioeconomic conditions surrounding Brazil, using the predictive models developed for other countries can make a very incomplete picture of the epidemic, since these differences could result in different patterns in low income settings. The aim of this work is to simulate interventions and understand the impact to reduce the spread of COVID-19 considering the socioeconomic conditions of Brazil. With this purpose we use an agent- based model (ABM), a subarea of the Artificial Intelligence, as it allows us to treat each individual in a personalized manner, as well as the environment of which they are part. The simulations have heterogeneous populations, considering different age groups, socioeconomic differences and number of members per family, contacts and movements intra and inter the sub-populations (favelas and non-favelas), numbers of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and study different scenarios to show how the interventions can influence the spread of the virus in the population of simulated environments.},

abstract = {The stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) updates its ensemble members with observations perturbed with noise sampled from the distribution of the observational errors. This was shown to introduce noise into the system and may become pronounced when the ensemble size is smaller than the rank of the observational error covariance, which is often the case in real oceanic and atmospheric data assimilation applications. This work introduces an efficient serial scheme to mitigate the impact of observations' perturbations sampling in the analysis step of the EnKF, which should provide more accurate ensemble estimates of the analysis error covariance matrices. The new scheme is simple to implement within the serial EnKF algorithm, requiring only the approximation of the EnKF sample forecast error covariance matrix by a matrix with one rank less. The new EnKF scheme is implemented and tested with the Lorenz-96 model. Results from numerical experiments are conducted to compare its performance with the EnKF and two standard deterministic EnKFs. This study shows that the new scheme enhances the behavior of the EnKF and may lead to better performance than the deterministic EnKFs even when implemented with relatively small ensembles.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a dynamic panel SIR (DP-SIR) model to investigate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the COVID-19 transmission dynamics with panel data from 9 countries across the globe. By constructing scenarios with different combinations of NPIs, our empirical findings suggest that countries may avoid the lockdown policy with imposing school closure, mask wearing and centralized quarantine to reach similar outcomes on controlling the COVID-19 infection. Our results also suggest that, as of April 4th, 2020, certain countries such as the U.S. and Singapore may require additional measures of NPIs in order to control disease transmissions more effectively, while other countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift some NPIs to mitigate the costs to the overall economy.},

abstract = {Getting good performance out of numerical equation solvers requires that the user has provided stable and efficient functions representing their model. However, users should not be trusted to write good code. In this manuscript we describe ModelingToolkit (MTK), a symbolic equation-based modeling system which allows for composable transformations to generate stable, efficient, and parallelized model implementations. MTK blurs the lines of traditional symbolic computing by acting directly on a user's numerical code. We show the ability to apply graph algorithms for automatically parallelizing and performing index reduction on code written for differential-algebraic equation (DAE) solvers, "fixing" the performance and stability of the model without requiring any changes to on the user's part. We demonstrate how composable model transformations can be combined with automated data-driven surrogate generation techniques, allowing machine learning methods to generate accelerated approximate models within an acausal modeling framework. These reduced models are shown to outperform the Dymola Modelica compiler on an HVAC model by 590x at 3$\backslash${\%} error. Together, this demonstrates MTK as a system for bringing the latest research in graph transformations directly to modeling applications.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to both the human health and economy of the affected nations. Despite several control efforts invested in breaking the transmission chain of the disease, there is a rise in the number of reported infected and death cases around the world. Hence, there is the need for a mathematical model that can reliably describe the real nature of the transmission behaviour and control of the disease. This study presents an appropriately developed deterministic compartmental model to investigate the effect of different pharmaceutical (treatment therapies) and non-pharmaceutical (particularly, human personal protection and contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals) control measures on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia. The data from daily reported cases of COVID-19 between 3 March and 31 December 2020 are used to parameterize the model. The basic reproduction number of the model is estimated. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effect of various control combination strategies involving the use of personal protection, contact tracing and testing, and treatment control measures on the disease spread. Numerical simulations reveal that the implementation of each strategy analysed can significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in the population. However, the results of effectiveness analysis suggest that a strategy that combines both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures averts the highest number of infections in the population.},

abstract = {During a pandemic such as COVID-19, managing public transit effectively becomes a critical policy decision. On the one hand, efficient transportation plays a pivotal role in enabling the movement of essential workers and keeping the economy moving. On the other hand, public transit can be a vector for disease propagation due to travelers' proximity within shared and enclosed spaces. Without strategic preparedness, mass transit facilities are potential hotbeds for spreading infectious diseases. Thus, transportation agencies face a complex trade-off when developing context-specific operating strategies for public transit. This work provides a network-based analysis framework for understanding this trade-off, as well as tools for calculating targeted commute restrictions under different policy constraints, e.g., regarding public health considerations (limiting infection levels) and economic activity (limiting the reduction in travel). The resulting plans ensure that the traffic flow restrictions imposed on each route are adaptive to the time-varying epidemic dynamics. A case study based on the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that a well-planned subway system in New York City can sustain 88$\backslash${\%} of transit flow while reducing the risk of disease transmission by 50 $\backslash${\%} relative to fully-loaded public transit systems. Transport policy-makers can exploit this optimization-based framework to address health-and-economic trade-offs and make proactive transit management plans during an epidemic outbreak.},

These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute.

abstract = {Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence. The national emergency response appears to have delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 February (day 50).},

abstract = {The global outbreak of COVID-19 requires us to accurately predict the spread of disease and decide how adopting corresponding strategies to ensure the sustainable development. Most of the existing infectious disease forecasting methods are based on the classical Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. However, due to the highly nonlinearity, nonstationarity, sensitivities to initial values and parameters, SIR type models would produce large deviations in the forecast results. Here, we propose a framework of using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate the model parameters, and then the data assimilation based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter to update model trajectory by cooperating with the real time confirmed cases, so as to improve the predictability of the pandemic. Based on this framework, we have developed a global COVID-19 real time forecasting system. Moreover, we suggest that big data associated with the spatiotemporally heterogeneous pathological characteristics, and social environment in different countries should be assimilated to further improve the COVID-19 predictability. It is hoped that the accurate prediction of COVID-19 will contribute to the adjustments of prevention and control strategies to contain the pandemic, and help achieve the SDG goal of “Good Health and Well-Being”.},

abstract = {Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we simulated the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number (R), and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02{\%}, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.},

abstract = {Background More than half of the global population is under strict forms of social distancing. Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. Methods We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in {\^{I}}le-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. Results We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95{\%} confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81{\%} reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case-finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. Conclusions As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.},

By conceptualizing interpersonal discussion and media selection behaviors as outcomes of identity-driven motivations shaped by political and psychological variables, the ideological health spirals model (IHSM) remedies a gap in current empirical analyses of COVID-related behaviors. The model explains how media fragmentation, political polarization, and social sorting reinforce communication discrepancies that create gaps in attitudinal, normative, and efficacyrelated beliefs, which then inform health behaviors. This process is cyclical; the beliefs that result from this identity-motivated process support the same identity-driven motivations that again encourage interpersonal network and media selection behaviors. The hope is that health communication scholars and public health experts can use the IHSM to (a) identify the groups least likely to receive or act on the most beneficial health messages and (b) determine the most effective expert-informed regulations, recommendations, and communication strategies to disrupt dysfunctional spirals},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has caused a global outbreak which represents a major threat to global health. Public health resorted to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and lockdown to slow down the spread of the pandemic. However, the effect of each of these measures remains hard to quantify. We design a multi-scale model that simulates the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We describe the motion of individual agents using a social force model. Each agent can be either susceptible, infected, quarantined, immunized or deceased. The model considers both mechanisms of direct and indirect transmission. We parameterize the model to reproduce the early dynamics of disease spread in Italy. We show that panic situations increase the risk of infection transmission in crowds despite social distancing measures. Next, we reveal that pre-symptomatic transmission accelerates the onset of the exponential growth of cases. After that, we demonstrate that the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces determines the number of cases reached during the peak of the epidemic. Then, we show that the restricted movement of the individuals flattens the epidemic curve. Finally, model predictions suggest that measures stricter than social distancing and lockdown were used to control the epidemic in Wuhan, China.},

abstract = {Background: National governments worldwide have implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions to control the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate its effects. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the prediction of future daily national confirmed COVID-19 infection growth—the percentage change in total cumulative cases—across 14 days for 114 countries using nonpharmaceutical intervention metrics and cultural dimension metrics, which are indicative of specific national sociocultural norms. Methods: We combined the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data set, Hofstede cultural dimensions, and daily reported COVID-19 infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non–time series machine learning models in predicting confirmed infection growth. We used three validation methods—in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation—for the evaluation, each of which was applicable to a different use case of the models. Results: Our results demonstrate high R2 values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution method (0.959) and moderate R2 values for the out-of-distribution and country-based cross-validation methods (0.513 and 0.574, respectively) using random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) regression. Although these models may be used to predict confirmed infection growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case. Conclusions: This work provides new considerations in using machine learning techniques with nonpharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions as metrics to predict the national growth of confirmed COVID-19 infections.},

abstract = {In this study, a nonlinear robust control policy is designed together with a state observer in order to manage the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak having an uncertain epidemiological model with unmeasurable variables. This nonlinear model for the COVID-19 epidemic includes eight state variables (susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, hospitalized, recovered, deceased, and insusceptible populations). Two plausible scenarios are put forward in this article to control this epidemic before and after its vaccine invention. In the first scenario, the social distancing and hospitalization rates are employed as two applicable control inputs to diminish the exposed and infected groups. However, in the second scenario after the vaccine development, the vaccination rate is taken into account as the third control input to reduce the susceptible populations, in addition to the two objectives of the first scenario. The proposed feedback control measures are defined in terms of the hospitalized and deceased populations due to the available statistical data, while other unmeasurable compartmental variables are estimated by an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In other words, the susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, and insusceptible individuals cannot be identified precisely because of the asymptomatic infection of COVID-19 in some cases, its incubation period, and the lack of an adequate community screening. Utilizing the Lyapunov theorem, the stability and bounded tracking convergence of the closed-loop epidemiological system are investigated in the presence of modeling uncertainties. Finally, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted based on Canada's reported cases for two defined timing plans (with different treatment rates). Obtained results demonstrate that the developed EKF-based control scheme can achieve desired epidemic goals (exponential decrease of infected, exposed, and susceptible people).},

abstract = {We develop a multi-group epidemic framework via virtual dispersal where the risk of infection is a function of the residence time and local environmental risk. This novel approach eliminates the need to define and measure contact rates that are used in the traditional multi-group epidemic models with heterogeneous mixing. We apply this approach to a general n-patch SIS model whose basic reproduction number R0 is computed as a function of a patch residence-time matrix P. Our analysis implies that the resulting n-patch SIS model has robust dynamics when patches are strongly connected: There is a unique globally stable endemic equilibrium when R0{\textgreater}1, while the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable when R0≤1. Our further analysis indicates that the dispersal behavior described by the residence-time matrix P has profound effects on the disease dynamics at the single patch level with consequences that proper dispersal behavior along with the local environmental risk can either promote or eliminate the endemic in particular patches. Our work highlights the impact of residence-time matrix if the patches are not strongly connected. Our framework can be generalized in other endemic and disease outbreak models. As an illustration, we apply our framework to a two-patch SIR single-outbreak epidemic model where the process of disease invasion is connected to the final epidemic size relationship. We also explore the impact of disease-prevalence-driven decision using a phenomenological modeling approach in order to contrast the role of constant versus state-dependent P on disease dynamics.},

abstract = {Neither the disease mechanism nor treatments for COVID-19 are currently known. Here, we present a novel molecular mechanism for COVID-19 that provides therapeutic intervention points that can be addressed with existing FDA-approved pharmaceuticals. The entry point for the virus is ACE2, which is a component of the counteracting hypotensive axis of RAS. Bradykinin is a potent part of the vasopressor system that induces hypotension and vasodilation and is degraded by ACE and enhanced by the angiotensin1-9 produced by ACE2. Here, we perform a new analysis on gene expression data from cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients that were used to sequence the virus. Comparison with BALF from controls identifies a critical imbalance in RAS represented by decreased expression of ACE in combination with increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, key RAS receptors, kinogen and many kallikrein enzymes that activate it, and both bradykinin receptors. This very atypical pattern of the RAS is predicted to elevate bradykinin levels in multiple tissues and systems that will likely cause increases in vascular dilation, vascular permeability and hypotension. These bradykinin-driven outcomes explain many of the symptoms being observed in COVID-19.},

abstract = {In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, governments are taking a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). These measures include interventions as stringent as strict lockdown but also school closure, bar and restaurant closure, curfews and barrier gestures i.e . social distancing. Disentangling the effectiveness of each NPI is crucial to inform response to future outbreaks. To this end, we first develop a multi-level estimation of the French COVID-19 epidemic over a period of one year. We rely on a global extended Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) mechanistic model of the infection including a dynamical (over time) transmission rate containing a Wiener process accounting for modeling error. Random effects are integrated following an innovative population approach based on a Kalman-type filter where the log-likelihood functional couples data across French regions. We then fit the estimated time-varying transmission rate using a regression model depending on NPI, while accounting for vaccination coverage, apparition of variants of concern (VoC) and seasonal weather conditions. We show that all NPI considered have an independent significant effect on the transmission rate. We additionally demonstrate a strong effect from weather conditions which decrease transmission during the summer period, and also estimate increased transmissibility of VoCs. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement This work is supported in part by Inria Mission COVID19, project GESTEPID. {\#}{\#}{\#} Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

abstract = {In Italy, 128,948 confirmed cases and 15,887 deaths of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were registered as of 5 April 2020. Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

The book combines mathematical models with extensive use ofepidemiological and other data. This analytic framework is highly useful forthe evaluation of public health strategies aimed at controlling or eradicatingparticular infections. Such a framework is increasingly important in light ofthe widespread concern for primary health care programs aimed at such diseasesas measles, malaria, river blindness, sleeping sickness, and schistosomiasis,and the advent of AIDS/HIV and other emerging viruses. Throughout the book,the mathematics is used as a tool for thinking clearly about fundamental andapplied problems having to do with infectious diseases. The book is dividedinto two parts, one dealing with microparasites (viruses, bacteria andprotozoans) and the other with macroparasites (helminths and parasiticarthropods). Each part begins with simple models, developed in a biologicallyintuitive way, and then goes on to develop more complicated and realisticmodels as tools for public health planning. The book synthesizes previous workin this rapidly growing field (much of which is scattered between theecological and the medical literature) with a good deal of new material.},

abstract = {A novel coronavirus pneumonia, first identified in Wuhan City and referred to as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization, has been quickly spreading to other cities and countries. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated. A well-mixed “susceptible exposed infectious recovered” (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6–18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.},

abstract = {Motivated by the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in mainland China, we use a global metapopulation disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. The model is calibrated on the basis of internationally reported cases and shows that, at the start of the travel ban from Wuhan on 23 January 2020, most Chinese cities had already received many infected travelers. The travel quarantine of Wuhan delayed the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days in mainland China but had a more marked effect on the international scale, where case importations were reduced by nearly 80{\%} until mid-February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90{\%} travel restrictions to and from mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50{\%} or higher reduction of transmission in the community.},

abstract = {The coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to all corners of the word, in a very complex manner. A key research focus is in predicting the development trend of COVID-19 scientifically through mathematical modelling. We conducted a systematic review of epidemic prediction models of COVID-19 and the public health intervention strategies by searching the Web of Science database. 55 studies of the COVID-19 epidemic model were reviewed systematically. It was found that the COVID-19 epidemic models were different in the model type, acquisition method, hypothesis and distribution of key input parameters. Most studies used the gamma distribution to describe the key time period of COVID-19 infection, and some studies used the lognormal distribution, the Erlang distribution, and the Weibull distribution. The setting ranges of the incubation period, serial interval, infectious period and generation time were 4.9–7 days, 4.41–8.4 days, 2.3–10 days and 4.4–7.5 days, respectively, and more than half of the incubation periods were set to 5.1 or 5.2 days. Most models assumed that the latent period was consistent with the incubation period. Some models assumed that asymptomatic infections were infectious or pre-symptomatic transmission was possible, which overestimated the value of R0. For the prediction differences under different public health strategies, the most significant effect was in travel restrictions. There were different studies on the impact of contact tracking and social isolation, but it was considered that improving the quarantine rate and reporting rate, and the use of protective face mask were essential for epidemic prevention and control. The input epidemiological parameters of the prediction models had significant differences in the prediction of the severity of the epidemic spread. Therefore, prevention and control institutions should be cautious when formulating public health strategies by based on the prediction results of mathematical models.},

abstract = {Model-driven policymaking for epidemic control is a challenging collaborative process. It begins when a team of public-health officials, epidemiologists, and economists construct a reasonably predictive disease model representative of the team's region of interest as a function of its unique socio-economic and demographic characteristics. As the team considers possible interventions such as school closures, social distancing, vaccination drives, etc., they need to simultaneously model each intervention's effect on disease spread and economic cost. The team then engages in an extensive what-if analysis process to determine a cost-effective policy: a schedule of when, where and how extensively each intervention should be applied. This policymaking process is often an iterative and laborious programming-intensive effort where parameters are introduced and refined, model and intervention behaviors are modified, and schedules changed. We have designed and developed EpiPolicy to support this effort. EpiPolicy is a policy aid and epidemic simulation tool that supports the mathematical specification and simulation of disease and population models, the programmatic specification of interventions and the declarative construction of schedules. EpiPolicy's design supports a separation of concerns in the modeling process and enables capabilities such as the iterative and automatic exploration of intervention plans with Monte Carlo simulations to find a cost-effective one. We report expert feedback on EpiPolicy. In general, experts found EpiPolicy's capabilities powerful and transformative, when compared with their current practice.},

Here, we apply an efficient embedded Runge-Kutta pair possessing superior stability and many other attractive features, including automatic global error control, in order to improve performance of the complex computational procedure consisting of the extended Kalman filter and the underlying adaptive ODE solver. Thus, we introduce a new continuous-discrete adaptive extended Kalman filter and show its advantage over the standard variant on two test examples. In practice, this technique allows for much longer sampling intervals without any loss of accuracy, and that improves the applied potential of the extended Kalman filtering method, significantly.},

@article{Wallinga2006,
abstract = {The estimation of transmission parameters has been problematic for diseases that rely predominantly on transmission of pathogens from person to person through small infectious droplets. Age-specific transmission parameters determine how such respiratory agents will spread among different age groups in a human population. Estimating the values of these parameters is essential in planning an effective response to potentially devastating pandemics of smallpox or influenza and in designing control strategies for diseases such as measles or mumps. In this study, the authors estimated age-specific transmission parameters by augmenting infectious disease data with auxiliary data on self-reported numbers of conversational partners per person. They show that models that use transmission parameters based on these self-reported social contacts are better able to capture the observed patterns of infection of endemically circulating mumps, as well as observed patterns of spread of pandemic influenza. The estimated age-specific transmission parameters suggested that school-aged children and young adults will experience the highest incidence of infection and will contribute most to further spread of infections during the initial phase of an emerging respiratory-spread epidemic in a completely susceptible population. These findings have important implications for controlling future outbreaks of novel respiratory-spread infectious agents.

abstract = {On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic1. The strategies based on non-pharmaceutical interventions that were used to contain the outbreak in China appear to be effective2, but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions and their timings3. Here, using epidemiological data on COVID-19 and anonymized data on human movement4,5, we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimate that there were a total of 114,325 cases of COVID-19 (interquartile range 76,776–164,576) in mainland China as of 29 February 2020. Without non-pharmaceutical interventions, we predict that the number of cases would have been 67-fold higher (interquartile range 44–94-fold) by 29 February 2020, and we find that the effectiveness of different interventions varied. We estimate that early detection and isolation of cases prevented more infections than did travel restrictions and contact reductions, but that a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. According to our model, the lifting of travel restrictions from 17 February 2020 does not lead to an increase in cases across China if social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of an on average 25{\%} reduction in contact between individuals that continues until late April. These findings improve our understanding of the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19, and will inform response efforts across the world.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity, habitat connectivity, and rates of movement can have large impacts on the persistence and extinction of infectious diseases. These factors are shown to determine the asymptotic profile of the steady states in a frequency-dependent SIS (susceptible-infectedsusceptible) epidemic model with n patches in which susceptible and infected individuals can both move between patches. Patch differences in local disease transmission and recovery rates characterize whether patches are low-risk or high-risk, and these differences collectively determine whether the spatial domain, or habitat, is low-risk or high-risk. The basic reproduction number R 0 for the model is determined. It is then shown that when the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R 0 {\textless} 1) it is globally asymptotically stable, and that when the disease-free equilibrium is unstable (R 0 {\textgreater} 1) there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. Two main theorems link spatial heterogeneity, habitat connectivity, and rates of movement to disease persistence and extinction. The first theorem relates the basic reproduction number to the heterogeneity of the spatial domain. For low-risk domains, the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R 0 {\textless} 1) if and only if the mobility of infected individuals lies above a threshold value, but for high-risk domains, the disease-free equilibrium is always unstable (R 0 {\textgreater} 1). The second theorem states that when the endemic equilibrium exists, it tends to a spatially inhomogeneous disease-free equilibrium as the mobility of susceptible individuals tends to zero. This limiting disease-free equilibrium has a positive number of susceptible individuals on all low-risk patches and can also have a positive number of susceptible individuals on some, but not all, high-risk patches. Sufficient conditions for whether high-risk patches in the limiting disease-free equilibrium have susceptible individuals or not are given in terms of habitat connectivity, and these conditions are illustrated using numerical examples. These results have important implications for disease control. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {Importance: Taiwan is one of the few countries with initial success in COVID-19 control without strict lockdown or school closure. The reasons remain to be fully elucidated. Objective: To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated. Results: This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53{\%}]). An estimated 55{\%} (95{\%} credible interval [CrI], 41{\%}-68{\%}) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95{\%} CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95{\%} CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95{\%} CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program. Mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic requires the collaborative effort of public health professionals and the general public..},

abstract = {The promise of efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is fulfilled and vaccination campaigns have started worldwide. However, the fight against the pandemic is far from over. Here, we propose an age-structured compartmental model to study the interplay of disease transmission, vaccines rollout, and behavioural dynamics. We investigate, via in-silico simulations, individual and societal behavioural changes, possibly induced by the start of the vaccination campaigns, and manifested as a relaxation in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We explore different vaccination rollout speeds, prioritization strategies, vaccine efficacy, as well as multiple behavioural responses. We apply our model to six countries worldwide (Egypt, Peru, Serbia, Ukraine, Canada, and Italy), selected to sample diverse socio-demographic and socio-economic contexts. To isolate the effects of age-structures and contacts patterns from the particular pandemic history of each location, we first study the model considering the same hypothetical initial epidemic scenario in all countries. We then calibrate the model using real epidemiological and mobility data for the different countries. Our findings suggest that early relaxation of safe behaviours can jeopardize the benefits brought by the vaccine in the short term: a fast vaccine distribution and policies aimed at keeping high compliance of individual safe behaviours are key to mitigate disease resurgence.},

abstract = {Several variables and practices affect the evolution and geographic spread of COVID-19. Some of these variables pertain to policy measures such as social distancing, quarantines for specific areas, and testing availability. In this paper, I analyze the effect that lockdown and testing policies had on new contagions in Chile, especially focusing on potential heterogeneity given by population characteristics. Leveraging a natural experiment in the determination of early quarantines, I use an Augmented Synthetic Control Method to build counterfactuals for high and lower-income areas that experienced a lockdown during the first two months of the pandemic. I find substantial differences in the impact that quarantine policies had for different populations: While lockdowns were effective in containing and reducing new cases of COVID-19 in higher-income municipalities, I find no significant effect of this measure for lower-income areas. To further explain these results, I test for difference in mobility during quarantine for high and lower-income municipalities, as well as delays in test results and testing availability. These findings are consistent with previous results, showing that differences in the effectiveness of lockdowns could be partially attributed to heterogeneity in quarantine compliance in terms of mobility, as well as differential testing availability for higher and lower-income areas.},

These findings are consistent with previous results, showing that differences in the effectiveness of lockdowns could be partially attributed to heterogeneity in quarantine compliance in terms of mobility, as well as differential testing availability for higher and lower-income areas."

"The basic reproduction number, R0 (referred to as the basic reproductive number
by some authors), is defined as the expected number of disease cases (secondary
infections) produced by a “typical” infected individual in a wholly susceptible
population over the full course of the disease outbreak. In an epidemic situation,
in which the time period is short enough to neglect demographic effects and all
infected individuals recover with full immunity against reinfection, the threshold
R0 = 1 is the dividing line between the infection dying out and the onset of an
epidemic." [p.6-7]

"However, at the beginning of a disease outbreak, there is a very small number of infective individuals and the transmission of infection is better captured if seen as a stochastic event that depends on the pattern of contacts between members of the population; a more satisfactory description should take such a stochastic pattern into account." [p.7]

"Past experiences and data have shown that the spread of infection in small populations is better captured in small communities as a random process. For this reason, stochastic models have an important role in disease transmission modeling." [p.8]

"In disease transmission models not all members of the population make contacts
at the same rate. In sexually transmitted diseases there is often a “core” group
of very active members who are responsible for most of the disease cases, and
control measures aimed at this core group have been very effective in control [27].
In epidemics there are often “super-spreaders”, who make many contacts and are
instrumental in spreading disease and in general some members of the population
make more contacts than others." [p. 188]

"Childhood diseases, such as measles, chicken pox, and rubella, are spread mainly
by contacts between children of similar ages. More than half of the deaths attributed to malaria are in children under 5 years of age due to their weaker immune systems. This suggests that in models for disease transmission in an age structured population it may be advisable to allow the contact rates between two members of the population to depend on the ages of both members. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are spread through partner interactions
with pair-formations, and the pair formations are age-dependent in most cases. For example, most AIDS cases occur in the group of young adults. More instances of age dependence may be found in [1]." [p. 429]},

abstract = {Pandemic is an unprecedented public health situation, especially for human beings with comorbidity. Vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions only remain extensive measures carrying a significant socioeconomic impact to defeating pandemic. Here, we formulate a mathematical model with comorbidity to study the transmission dynamics as well as an optimal control-based framework to diminish COVID-19. This encompasses modeling the dynamics of invaded population, parameter estimation of the model, study of qualitative dynamics, and optimal control problem for non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination events such that the cost of the combined measure is minimized. The investigation reveals that disease persists with the increase in exposed individuals having comorbidity in society. The extensive computational efforts show that mean fluctuations in the force of infection increase with corresponding entropy. This is a piece of evidence that the outbreak has reached a significant portion of the population. However, optimal control strategies with combined measures provide an assurance of effectively protecting our population from COVID-19 by minimizing social and economic costs.},

abstract = {Against the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide have devised a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate it. However, it is generally difficult to estimate the joint impact of different control strategies. In this paper, we tackle this question with an extended epidemic SEIR model, informed by a socio-political classification of different interventions. First, we inquire the conceptual effect of mitigation parameters on the infection curve. Then, we illustrate the potential of our model to reproduce and explain empirical data from a number of countries, to perform cross-country comparisons. This gives information on the best synergies of interventions to control epidemic outbreaks while minimising impact on socio-economic needs. For instance, our results suggest that, while rapid and strong lockdown is an effective pandemic mitigation measure, a combination of social distancing and early contact tracing can achieve similar mitigation synergistically, while keeping lower isolation rates. This quantitative understanding can support the establishment of mid- and long-term interventions, to prepare containment strategies against further outbreaks. This paper also provides an online tool that allows researchers and decision makers to interactively simulate diverse scenarios with our model.},

Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with computational models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing, and vaccination programmes. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day, allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 are its Python and R interfaces, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.},

abstract = {This paper presents a data-driven approach for COVID-19 modeling and forecasting, which can be used by public policy and decision makers to control the outbreak through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI). First, we apply an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt). We use daily confirmed cases, active cases, recovered cases, deceased cases, Case-Fatality-Rate (CFR), and infectious time as inputs for the model. Furthermore, we define a Transmission Index (TI) as a ratio between the instantaneous and the maximum value of the effective reproduction number. The value of TI indicates the “effectiveness” of the disease transmission from a contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual in the presence of current measures, such as physical distancing and lock-down, relative to a normal condition. Based on the value of TI, we forecast different scenarios to see the effect of relaxing and tightening public measures. Case studies in three countries are provided to show the practicability of our approach.},

abstract = {Sanitary Emergency Measures (SEM) were implemented in Mexico on March 30th, 2020 requiring the suspension of non-essential activities. This action followed a Healthy Distance Sanitary action on March 23rd, 2020. The aim of both measures was to reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico by lowering the effective contact rate. Using a modification of the Kermack–McKendrick SEIR model we explore the effect of behavioral changes required to lower community transmission by introducing a time-varying contact rate, and the consequences of disease spread in a population subject to suspension of non-essential activities. Our study shows that there exists a trade-off between the proportion of the population under SEM and the average time an individual is committed to all the behavioral changes needed to achieve an effective social distancing. This trade-off generates an optimum value for the proportion of the population under strict mitigation measures, significantly below 1 in some cases, that minimizes maximum COVID-19 incidence. We study the population-level impact of three key factors: the implementation of behavior change control measures, the time horizon necessary to reduce the effective contact rate and the proportion of people under SEM in combating COVID-19. Our model is fitted to the available data. The initial phase of the epidemic, from February 17th to March 23rd, 2020, is used to estimate the contact rates, infectious periods and mortality rate using both confirmed cases (by date of symptoms initiation), and daily mortality. Data on deaths after March 23rd, 2020 is used to estimate the mortality rate after the mitigation measures are implemented. Our simulations indicate that the most likely dates for maximum incidence are between late May and early June, 2020 under a scenario of high SEM compliance and low SEM abandonment rate.},

However, its effectiveness for improving human motion tracking for virtual reality applications in the presence of noisy data has been unexplored. In this paper, we present an empirical study comparing the performance of unscented and extended Kalman filtering for improving human head and hand tracking. Specifically, we examine human head and hand orientation motion signals, represented with quaternions, which are critical for correct viewing perspectives in virtual reality. Our experimental results and analysis indicate that unscented Kalman filtering performs equivalently with extended Kalman filtering. However, the additional computational overhead of the unscented Kalman filter and quasi-linear nature of the quaternion dynamics lead to the conclusion that the extended Kalman filter is a better choice for estimating quaternion motion in virtual reality applications.},

abstract = {Background: The dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are complicated by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection, and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines, necessitating the use of mathematical models. Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. Methods: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95{\%} in those aged 80 years and older, 85{\%} in those aged 50–79 years, and 75{\%} in those aged 18–49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88{\%} on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0{\%} to 85{\%}. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. Findings: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85{\%} of infections, we estimate R to be 1{\textperiodcentered}58 (95{\%} credible intervals [CI] 1{\textperiodcentered}36–1{\textperiodcentered}84) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95{\%} CI 1400–55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85{\%} of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800–173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60{\%} of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60{\%} protection against infection, 48{\textperiodcentered}3{\%} (95{\%} CI 48{\textperiodcentered}1–48{\textperiodcentered}5) and 16{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} (15{\textperiodcentered}7–16{\textperiodcentered}3) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. Interpretation: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the capacity to generate variants with major genomic changes. The UK variant B.1.1.7 (also known as VOC 202012/01) has many mutations that alter virus attachment and entry into human cells. Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches, Davies et al. characterized the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant in the United Kingdom. The authors found that the variant is 43 to 90{\%} more transmissible than the predecessor lineage but saw no clear evidence for a change in disease severity, although enhanced transmission will lead to higher incidence and more hospital admissions. Large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur after the easing of control measures, and it may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to control the epidemic. Science , this issue p. eabg3055 The major coronavirus variant that emerged at the end of 2020 in the UK is more transmissible than its predecessors and could spark resurgences.A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant, VOC 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7), emerged in southeast England in September 2020 and is rapidly spreading toward fixation. Using a variety of statistical and dynamic modeling approaches, we estimate that this variant has a 43 to 90{\%} (range of 95{\%} credible intervals, 38 to 130{\%}) higher reproduction number than preexisting variants. A fitted two-strain dynamic transmission model shows that VOC 202012/01 will lead to large resurgences of COVID-19 cases. Without stringent control measures, including limited closure of educational institutions and a greatly accelerated vaccine rollout, COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths across England in the first 6 months of 2021 were projected to exceed those in 2020. VOC 202012/01 has spread globally and exhibits a similar transmission increase (59 to 74{\%}) in Denmark, Switzerland, and the United States.},

abstract = {The extended Kalman filter is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation of non-linear systems through linearizing non-linear models. In recent several decades people have realized that there are a lot of constraints in application of the EKF for its hard implementation and intractability. In this paper a new estimation method is proposed, which takes advantage of the Unscented Transformation method thus approximating the true mean and variance more accurately. The new method can be applied to non-linear systems without the linearization process necessary for the EKF, and it does not demand a Gaussian distribution of noise and what's more, its ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features enables it to demonstrate its good performance in numerical experiments of satellite orbit simulation.},

abstract = {Ebola is a highly infectious disease generally characterized by sporadic outbreaks. A deterministic Ebola model is formulated and converted into It{\^{o}} stochastic differential equations by adding noise on each compartment. In order to estimate the model parameter values, we use the extended Kalman filter technique as the filtering method and sum of square of errors to compute an approximation of the likelihood. From the obtained likelihood function, the maximum likelihood and MCMC methods for parameters estimation are then used. These parameter estimates provide useful information on quantities of epidemiological interest. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the model error covariance is set to be zero and (2) the bias is fully incorporated into the model. A comparison between these two cases is carried out to assess whether the bias is having a measure effect on parameters and states estimation. Finally, we investigate whether an estimate obtained from a biased study differs systematically from the true source population of the study. Our results indicate that the more the increase of bias, the more the noise in states simulation and parameters estimation compared to the deterministic model.},

abstract = {A model for the spread of infectious diseases among discrete geographic regions is presented that incorporates a mobility process that describes how contact occurs between individuals from different regions. The general formulation of the mobility process is described, and it is shown that the formulation encapsulates a range of mobility behavior from complete isolation of all regions (no mobility) to permanent migration between regions. It is then shown how this mobility process fits into an SIR epidemic model, and two examples are given extending its use. The examples include a model for disease transmission in a population with two distinct mobility patterns operating and a model developed to describe a 1984 measles epidemic on the Caribbean island of Dominica. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Governments are attempting to control the COVID-19 pandemic with nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). However, it is still largely unknown how effective different NPIs are at reducing transmission. Data-driven studies can estimate the effectiveness of NPIs while minimising assumptions, but existing analyses lack sufficient data and validation to robustly distinguish the effects of individual NPIs. We gather chronological data on NPIs in 41 countries between January and the end of May 2020, creating the largest public NPI dataset collected with independent double entry. We then estimate the effectiveness of 8 NPIs with a Bayesian hierarchical model by linking NPI implementation dates to national case and death counts. The results are supported by extensive empirical validation, including 11 sensitivity analyses with over 200 experimental conditions. We find that closing schools and universities was highly effective; that banning gatherings and closing high-risk businesses was effective, but closing most other businesses had limited further benefit; and that many countries may have been able to reduce R below 1 without issuing a stay-at-home order.},

abstract = {Following the detection of the new coronavirus1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In response, many European countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as the closure of schools and national lockdowns. Here we study the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries, with both individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used, helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete, show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future consolidation. We estimate that—for all of the countries we consider here—current interventions have been sufficient to drive Rt below 1 (probability Rt {\textless} 1.0 is greater than 99{\%}) and achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11 countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between 3.2{\%} and 4.0{\%} of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions—and lockdowns in particular—have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control.},

abstract = {The substantial increase in the number of daily new cases infected with coronavirus around the world is alarming, and several researchers are currently using various mathematical and machine learning-based prediction models to estimate the future trend of this pandemic. In this work, we employed the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected daily number of COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia in the next four weeks. We first performed four different prediction models; Autoregressive Model, Moving Average, a combination of both (ARMA), and integrated ARMA (ARIMA), to determine the best model fit, and we found out that the ARIMA model outperformed the other models. The forecasting results showed that the trend in Saudi Arabia will continue growing and may reach up to 7668 new cases per day and over 127,129 cumulative daily cases in a matter of four weeks if stringent precautionary and control measures are not implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19. This indicates that the Umrah and Hajj Pilgrimages to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia that are supposedly scheduled to be performed by nearly 2 million Muslims in mid-July may be suspended. A set of extreme preventive and control measures are proposed in an effort to avoid such a situation.},

abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic markedly changed human mobility patterns, necessitating epidemiological models that can capture the effects of these changes in mobility on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Here we introduce a metapopulation susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ten of the largest US metropolitan areas. Our mobility networks are derived from mobile phone data and map the hourly movements of 98 million people from neighbourhoods (or census block groups) to points of interest such as restaurants and religious establishments, connecting 56,945 census block groups to 552,758 points of interest with 5.4 billion hourly edges. We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in the behaviour of the population over time. Our model predicts that a small minority of ‘superspreader' points of interest account for a large majority of the infections, and that restricting the maximum occupancy at each point of interest is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our model also correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups2–8 solely as the result of differences in mobility: we find that disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce their mobility as sharply, and that the points of interest that they visit are more crowded and are therefore associated with higher risk. By capturing who is infected at which locations, our model supports detailed analyses that can inform more-effective and equitable policy responses to COVID-19.},

@article{Tseng2021a,
abstract = {Background: The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been characterized as a worldwide pandemic. Currently, there are few preclinical animal models that suitably represent infection, as the main point of entry to human cells is via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is not present in typical preclinical mouse strains. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent and unsafe for use in many research facilities. Here we describe the development of a preclinical animal model using intranasal administration of ACE2 followed by non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) challenge. Methods: To specifically generate our SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we used a lentivirus system. Following co-transfection with a packaging plasmid containing HIV Gag and Pol, luciferase-expressing lentiviruses, and a plasmid carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 PsVs can be isolated and purified. To better understand and maximize the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we generated PsV carrying spike protein variants known to have varying human ACE2 binding properties, including 19 deletion (19del) and 19del + D614G. Results: Our system demonstrated the ability of PsVs to infect the respiratory passage of mice following intranasal hACE2 transduction. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo manipulability of our system using recombinant receptor-binding domain protein to prevent PsV infection. Conclusions: Our PsV system is able to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in a preclinical mouse model and can be used to test interventions or preventative treatments. We believe that this method can be extended to work in various mouse strains or to model infection with different coronaviruses. A simple in vivo system such as our model is crucial for rapidly and effectively responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in addition to preparing for future potential coronavirus outbreaks.},

abstract = {Voluntary shelter-in-place directives and lockdowns are the main non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have used to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 50$\backslash${\%} to 90$\backslash${\%} depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions are only 20$\backslash${\%} to 50$\backslash${\%} for lower-income communities. The large reductions in higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: roughly, a 10$\backslash${\%} increase in mobility correlates with a 5$\backslash${\%} increase in the rate of infection. Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city. Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable their inhabitants to increase compliance.},

abstract = {Objectives We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. Design We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. Setting One anonymous large urban US jail. Participants Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. Interventions There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. Primary and secondary outcome measures The basic reproduction ratio, R 0, in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). Results For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95{\%} credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95{\%} CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95{\%} CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95{\%} CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83{\%} of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. Conclusions Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.},

abstract = {Background: In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods: To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). Findings: Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92{\%} (IQR 66–97) and 24{\%} (13–90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. Interpretation: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

"Although contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include information on which setting the contact took place in, such studies are often focused on high-income countries [11], or particular high-density areas [12]. This limitation can be addressed by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work, and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structures [13]."[p.2]

We remove concurrent policy bias by taking into account the contemporaneous presence of multiple interventions. The main result of the paper is that cancelling public events and imposing restrictions on private gatherings followed by school closures have quantitatively the most pronounced effects on reducing the daily incidence of COVID-19. They are followed by workplace as well as stay-at-home requirements, whose statistical significance and levels of effect are not as pronounced. Instead, we find no effects for international travel controls, public transport closures and restrictions on movements across cities and regions. We establish that these findings are mediated by their effect on population mobility patterns in a manner consistent with time-use and epidemiological factors.},

During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.},

abstract = {With the recent resurgence of vector-borne diseases due to urbanization and development there is an urgent need to understand the dynamics of vector-borne diseases in rapidly changing urban environments. For example, many empirical studies have produced the disturbing finding that diseases continue to persist in modern city centers with zero or low rates of transmission. We develop spatial models of vector-borne disease dynamics on a network of patches to examine how the movement of humans in heterogeneous environments affects transmission. We show that the movement of humans between patches is sufficient to maintain disease persistence in patches with zero transmission. We construct two classes of models using different approaches: (i) Lagrangian models that mimic human commuting behavior and (ii) Eulerian models that mimic human migration. We determine the basic reproduction number R0 for both modeling approaches. We show that for both approaches that if the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R0 {\textless} 1) then it is globally stable and if the disease-free equilibrium is unstable (R0 {\textgreater} 1) then there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium that is globally stable among positive solutions. Finally, we prove in general that Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling approaches are not equivalent. The modeling approaches presented provide a framework to explore spatial vector-borne disease dynamics and control in heterogeneous environments. As an example, we consider two patches in which the disease dies out in both patches when there is no movement between them. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the disease becomes endemic in both patches when humans move between the two patches. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80{\%} of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50{\%} or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a "mouth-and-nose lockdown" is far more sustainable than a "full body lockdown", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.},

Various mathematical models have been proposed to understand the behaviour of the disease, but most of them were failed to predict the biological phenomenon of this infectious diseases since they use incorrect assumptions due to early stage symptoms. The aim of this paper is to develop a covid-19 mathematical model with nonlinear incidence rate. We use some logical assumption to develop the model. We discretize the model by using Euler method. We use literature review in our research methodology. Then, we simulate the model by using computer software. We found that this model has two equilibrium points, namely disease free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The stability of the model is changed by increament or decreament of the step-size. If the step-size of the model is large enough, then it lead numerical solution to blown up. Finally, we also found that this model is fair enough to simulate the pandemic in our case. Also, we found some interesting phenomenon from our simulation that is the effect of government policies or social distancing. Further work is needed to analyze the stability of the model and the effect of delay.},

abstract = {The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a worldwide crisis in public health. It is crucial we understand the epidemiological trends and impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns for effective management of the disease and control of its spread. We develop and validate a novel intelligent computational model to predict epidemiological trends of COVID-19, with the model parameters enabling an evaluation of the impact of NPIs. By representing the number of daily confirmed cases (NDCC) as a time-series, we assume that, with or without NPIs, the pattern of the pandemic satisfies a series of Gaussian distributions according to the central limit theorem. The underlying pandemic trend is first extracted using a singular spectral analysis (SSA) technique, which decomposes the NDCC time series into the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slow varying trend, oscillatory components and structureless noise. We then use a mixture of Gaussian fitting (GF) to derive a novel predictive model for the SSA extracted NDCC incidence trend, with the overall model termed SSA-GF. Our proposed model is shown to accurately predict the NDCC trend, peak daily cases, the length of the pandemic period, the total confirmed cases and the associated dates of the turning points on the cumulated NDCC curve. Further, the three key model parameters, specifically, the amplitude (alpha), mean (mu), and standard deviation (sigma) are linked to the underlying pandemic patterns, and enable a directly interpretable evaluation of the impact of NPIs, such as strict lockdowns and travel restrictions. The predictive model is validated using available data from China and South Korea, and new predictions are made, partially requiring future validation, for the cases of Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. Comparative results demonstrate that the introduction of consistent control measures across countries can lead to development of similar parametric models, reflected in particular by relative variations in their underlying sigma, alpha and mu values. The paper concludes with a number of open questions and outlines future research directions.},

abstract = {Prediction of COVID-19 spread plays a significant role in the epidemiology study and government battles against the epidemic. However, the existing studies on COVID-19 prediction are dominated by constant model parameters, unable to reflect the actual situation of COVID-19 spread. This paper presents a new method for dynamic prediction of COVID-19 spread by considering time-dependent model parameters. This method discretises the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model in time domain to construct the nonlinear state-space equation for dynamic estimation of COVID-19 spread. A maximum likelihood estimation theory is established to online estimate time-dependent model parameters. Subsequently, an extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate dynamic COVID-19 spread based on the online estimated model parameters. The proposed method is applied to simulate and analyse the COVID-19 pandemics in China and the United States based on daily reported cases, demonstrating its efficacy in modelling and prediction of COVID-19 spread.},

"This paper presents a novel method for prediction and analysis
of dynamic COVID-19 spread based on the SEIRD epidemiological model with time-dependent model parameters. By discretising the SEIRD epidemiological model in time domain, the nonlinear state- space equation for describing COVID-19 dynamics is constructed to simultaneously estimate the time-dependent model parameters and transmission state. The time-varying model parameters are es- timated according to the maximum likelihood principle to account for the dynamic effects of the infection, death and recovery rates on COVID-19 spread. Subsequently, an EKF is developed to dynami- cally estimate the transmission state based on the online estimated model parameters for COVID-19 forecast." [p. 2]

We first show how the recently developed sigma-point approximations as well as the multi-dimensional Gauss-Hermite quadrature and cubature approximations can be applied to classical continuous-discrete Gaussian filtering. We then derive two types of new Gaussian approximation based smoothers for continuous-discrete models and apply the numerical methods to the smoothers. We also show how the latter smoother can be efficiently implemented by including one additional cross-covariance differential equation to the filter prediction step.

The method is based on the fact that in the SIR model, R is linearly related to the growth rate of the number of infected individuals. This time-varying growth rate is estimated using the Kalman filter from data on new cases. The method is easy to implement in standard statistical software, and it performs well even when the number of infected individuals is imperfectly measured, or the infection does not follow the SIR model. Our estimates of R for COVID-19 for 124 countries across the world are provided in an interactive online dashboard, and they are used to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in a sample of 14 European countries.},

Our results also suggest that, as of April 4th, 2020, certain countries such as the U.S. and Singapore may require additional measures of NPIs in order to control disease transmissions more effectively, while other countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift some NPIs to mitigate the costs to the overall economy.},

abstract = {Origin-Destination surveys, which are regularly conducted in many cities (to calibrate transport models), contain indirect information on individual time use that can be recovered through the declared trip purpose. Although this data source is very rich, it has two limitations for the calibration of time use models: the level of disaggregation regarding time use is constrained by the definition of trip purposes, and the information gathered on different time periods is usually obtained from different individuals. In this paper we propose a new method to overcome the second limitation, transforming the original daily observations into individual-weeks. For every working day observation we build Saturday and Sunday "twins" as a convex combination of observed weekend individuals such that the distance between the attributes of the working day individual and the synthetic twin is minimized. We applied this procedure to the Santiago OD survey, and generated a database of weekly observations particularly rich for model calibration and segmentation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

"As the travel diary is focused on travelling, activities conducted inside the house have to remain as a single category, while activities conducted outside the house can be identified with more detail, but always constrained to the definition of trip purposes. For example, if only one purpose is recorded per trip, then it is not possible to obtain information about time assignment to more than one activity at the same time and location. However, it is possible to identify time assigned to activities at different locations. The time interval between two consecutive trips is assigned to the activity associated to the purpose declared for the first trip. Figure 1 represents this simple procedure. This data transformation process assumes that the cycle begins when the individual is at home. This assumption can be verified by checking whether the OD zone registered in the survey as the origin of the first trip of the day includes the address of the user's house."

abstract = {There is a range of public health tools and interventions to address the global pandemic of COVID-19. Although it is essential for public health efforts to comprehensively identify which interventions have the largest impact on preventing new cases, most of the modeling studies that support such decision-making efforts have only considered a very small set of interventions. In addition, previous studies predominantly represented interventions as independent or examined a single scenario in which every possible intervention was applied. Reality has been more nuanced, as a subset of all possible interventions may be in effect for a given time period, in a given place. In this paper, we use cloud-based simulations and a previously published Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 (Covasim) to measure the individual and interacting contribution of interventions on reducing new infections in the US over 6 months. Simulated interventions include face masks, working remotely, stay-at-home orders, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining. Through a factorial design of experiments, we find that mask wearing together with transitioning to remote work/schooling has the largest impact. Having sufficient capacity to immediately and effectively perform contact tracing has a smaller contribution, primarily via interacting effects.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has directly impacted the public health and economy worldwide. To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50{\%} of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic.},

abstract = {In response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, unprecedented travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders were enacted around the world. Ultimately, the public's response to announcements of lockdowns—defined as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel—will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we evaluate the effects of lockdowns on human mobility and simulate how these changes may affect epidemic spread by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We show that in 2020 following lockdown announcements but prior to their implementation, both local and long distance movement increased in multiple locations, and urban-to-rural migration was observed around the world. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. Our model shows that this increased movement has the potential to increase seeding of the epidemic in less urban areas, which could undermine the goal of the lockdown in preventing disease spread. Lockdowns play a key role in reducing contacts and controlling outbreaks, but appropriate messaging surrounding their announcement and careful evaluation of changes in mobility are needed to mitigate the possible unintended consequences.},

"to a generic approach where the population is divided into an arbitrary number of groups, each with the SEIR structure, interacting in an arbitrary number of locations (‘patches') [19], with the times spent by member of each group in each location characterized by a set of mixing matrices. The latter somewhat abstract approach is an extension on earlier works in this direc- tion [20–23] where particular, more disease-specific, situation were considered. A shortcoming of the developed approach, apparent once it is reduced to its simplest variant, is that, according to it, a representative susceptible comes in contact only with one person in a given ‘patch', so that the probability of coming across an infective is the ratio of the number of infectives to the total population in this patch. Neither the groups nor the patches are linked with social activities and this makes it difficult to specify the matrices involved for a practical application of the model, and the basic SEIR scheme makes it problematic to account for the infectiveness ‘profile' of a disease in question. The latter aspect is of particular importance in the situations where many cases go asymptomatically with varying infectivity and/or if the infection has a long latent period."[p.2-3]

abstract = {Reports appear to give reassurance that vertical transmission near term is unlikely, but risks of incidental SARS-CoV-2 infection during fertility treatments, at embryo implantation, or in the first trimester remain unknown. If early pregnancy sequela in the current COVID-19 pandemic are modeled from the 2004 Coronavirus outbreak data, then SARS-CoV-2 infection proximate to blastocyst nidation is likely to cause implantation failure or spontaneous abortion. Our model explains why this outcome is less attributable to virus-associated maternal pulmonary distress and instead derives from systemic inflammation and interference with trophectoderm-endometrium molecular signaling required for implantation. COVID-19 is often accompanied by high levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and other cytokines, a process implicated in pulmonary collapse and systemic organ failure. Yet when regarded in an early reproductive context, this “cytokine storm” of COVID-19 triggers a procoagulative state hostile to normal in utero blastocyst/fetal development. Evidence from obstetrics is accumulating to show that mothers with SARS-CoV-2 deliver placentas with abnormal interstitial villi fibrin deposits, diffuse infarcts, and hemangiomatous changes. This model classifies such lesions as permissive at term but catastrophic near embryo implantation or early first trimester pregnancy. Clinical experience with recurrent pregnancy loss offers workable interventions to address this challenge, but success will depend on prompt and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Although no professional guidelines currently exist for SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy, this model would warrant a high-risk designation for such cases; these patients should receive priority access to screening and treatment resources.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to both the human health and economy of the affected nations. Despite several control efforts invested in breaking the transmission chain of the disease, there is a rise in the number of reported infected and death cases around the world. Hence, there is the need for a mathematical model that can reliably describe the real nature of the transmission behaviour and control of the disease. This study presents an appropriately developed deterministic compartmental model to investigate the effect of different pharmaceutical (treatment therapies) and non-pharmaceutical (particularly, human personal protection and contact tracing and testing on the exposed individuals) control measures on COVID-19 population dynamics in Malaysia. The data from daily reported cases of COVID-19 between 3 March and 31 December 2020 are used to parameterize the model. The basic reproduction number of the model is estimated. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effect of various control combination strategies involving the use of personal protection, contact tracing and testing, and treatment control measures on the disease spread. Numerical simulations reveal that the implementation of each strategy analysed can significantly reduce COVID-19 incidence and prevalence in the population. However, the results of effectiveness analysis suggest that a strategy that combines both the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical control measures averts the highest number of infections in the population.},

Zhang et al. modeled virus transmission in Wuhan, China, in February 2020, investigating the effects of interventions ranging from patient management to social isolation. Age-mixing patterns were estimated by contact surveys conducted in Wuhan and Shanghai at the beginning of February 2020. Once people reduced their average daily contacts from 14 to 20 down to 2, transmission rapidly fell below the epidemic threshold. The model also showed that preemptive school closures helped to reduce transmission, although alone they would not prevent a COVID-19 outbreak. Limiting human mixing to within households appeared to be the most effective measure.},

abstract = {Dengue fever has become one of the most outstanding infectious diseases in the world. Besides, the incidence and prevalence of dengue are increasing in the endemic areas of the tropical and subtropical regions. Space and time disease mapping models are common instruments to explain the patterns of disease counts, where hierarchical Bayesian models constitute a suitable framework for their formulation. These random events reflect interactions between nearby geographic locations, as well as correlations between close temporary instants. Functional data analysis techniques can better describe the evolution of disease mapping. In this paper, the risk of dengue in Mexico, Central and South America is studied from a Functional approach through a Bayesian estimation model focused on Hilbert-valued autoregressive processes combined with the Kalman filtering algorithm. Thus, the temporal functional evolution of spatial geographic patterns of incidence risk in disease mapping during 1998-2018 is approximated. Applying this methodology, the excess of smoothing that occurs with traditional models is avoided and the heterogeneity is conserved across the years. It improves the number of false positives created by noise and the number of false negatives as well. The results obtained with the application of this model are compared with those of previous models, corroborating the preceding statements and obtaining better results in the relative risk estimates, providing greater robustness and stability of disease risk estimates.},

The main objective is to unveil the evolution of the number of real infected people, and consequently to predict the peak of the epidemic and subsequent evolution. For this purpose, an original nonlinear model relating the raw data with the time-varying geometric ratio of infected people is elaborated, and a Kalman Filter is used to estimate the involved state variables. A hypothetical simulated case is used to show the adequacy and limitations of the proposed method. Then, several countries, including China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, UK and the USA, are tested to illustrate its behavior when real-life data are processed. The results obtained clearly show the beneficial effect of the severe lockdowns imposed by many countries worldwide, but also that the softer social distancing measures adopted afterwards have been almost always insufficient to prevent the second virus wave.},

It implies that the moment differential equations for calculation of the predicted state mean and error covariance of propagated Gaussian density are solved accurately, i.e., with negligible errors. The latter allows the total error of the extended Kalman filter to be reduced significantly and results in a new accurate continuous–discrete extended Kalman filtering method. In addition, this filter exploits the scaled local and global error controls to avoid any comparison of different physical units. The designed state estimator is compared numerically with continuous–discrete unscented and cubature Kalman filters to expose its practical efficiency.

abstract = {Six months into the pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing, lockdowns) are the only available measure to control severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Around the world, policymakers have implemented localized lockdowns in small geographic areas to prevent the spread of the disease. As governments ease restrictions, localized lockdowns are becoming a relevant policy option in cases of resurgence, as they can, in principle, reduce social and economic costs compared to larger-scale SARS-CoV-2 suppression strategies. The effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been typically described using mathematical models; however, there is a lack of empirical evidence of their causal effects to inform health policy. Using an integrated dataset from Chile, we estimated the direct and indirect (spillover) causal effects of localized lockdowns on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that the effectiveness of localized lockdowns is strongly modulated by duration and is affected by spillover effects from neighboring geographic areas. Our projections suggest that extending localized lockdowns will slow down the epidemic. However, by themselves, localized lockdowns will be unable to control epidemic growth due to spillovers from neighboring areas with high interdependencies, unless those contiguous areas also implement lockdowns.},

abstract = {Optimal economic evaluation is pivotal in prioritising the implementation of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions in the control of diseases. Governments, decision-makers and policy-makers broadly need information about the effectiveness of a control intervention concerning its cost-benefit to evaluate whether a control intervention offers the best value for money. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, and the eventual spread to other parts of the world, have pushed governments and health authorities to take drastic socioeconomic, sociocultural and sociopolitical measures to curb the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. To help policy-makers, health authorities and governments, we propose a Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Quarantined asymptomatic, Severely infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, Recovered asymptomatic, Deceased, and Protective susceptible (individuals who observe health protocols) compartmental structure to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. We fit the model to real data from Ghana and Egypt to estimate model parameters using standard incidence rate. Projections for disease control and sensitivity analysis are presented using MATLAB. We noticed that multiple peaks (waves) of COVID-19 for Ghana and Egypt can be prevented if stringent health protocols are implemented for a long time and/or the reluctant behaviour on the use of protective equipment by individuals are minimized. The sensitivity analysis suggests that: the rate of diagnoses and testing, the rate of quarantine through doubling enhanced contact tracing, adhering to physical distancing, adhering to wearing of nose masks, sanitizing-washing hands, media education remains the most effective measures in reducing the control reproduction number Rc, to less than unity in the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs in Ghana and Egypt. Optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis are rigorously studied. The main finding is that having two controls (transmission reduction and case isolation) is better than having one control, but is economically expensive. In case only one control is affordable, then transmission reduction is better than case isolation. Hopefully, the results of this research should help policy-makers when dealing with multiple waves of COVID-19.},

In this framework, we model host mobility that depends on its epidemiological status, by a Lagrangian approach. This framework is applied to a general SEIRS model and the basic reproduction number R 0 is derived. The effects of heterogeneity in groups, patches and mobility patterns on R 0 and disease prevalence are explored. Our results show that for a fixed number of groups, the basic reproduction number increases with respect to the number of patches and the host mobility patterns. Moreover, when the mobility matrix of susceptible individuals is of rank one, the basic reproduction number is explicitly determined and was found to be independent of the latter if the matrix is also stochastic. The cases where mobility matrices are of rank one capture important modeling scenarios. Additionally, we study the global analysis of equilibria for some special cases. Numerical simulations are carried out to showcase the ramifications of mobility pattern matrices on disease prevalence and basic reproduction number.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with R0 = 2.45, the SEIR model infects 87{\%} of the resident population while our agent-based model infects only around 23{\%} of the resident population. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns are very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low coverage, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30{\%} of the population fully immune. When vaccinating in the midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19.},

abstract = {A multipatch model is proposed to study the impact of travel on the spatial spread of disease between patches with different level of disease prevalence. The basic reproduction number for the ith patch in isolation is obtained along with the basic reproduction number of the system of patches, R 0. Inequalities describing the relationship between these numbers are also given. For a two-patch model with one high prevalence patch and one low prevalence patch, results pertaining to the dependence of R 0 on the travel rates between the two patches are obtained. For parameter values relevant for influenza, these results show that, while banning travel of infectives from the low to the high prevalence patch always contributes to disease control, banning travel of symptomatic travelers only from the high to the low prevalence patch could adversely affect the containment of the outbreak under certain ranges of parameter values. Moreover, banning all travel of infected individuals from the high to the low prevalence patch could result in the low prevalence patch becoming diseasefree, while the high prevalence patch becomes even more disease-prevalent, with the resulting number of infectives in this patch alone exceeding the combined number of infectives in both patches without border control. Under the set of parameter values used, our results demonstrate that if border control is properly implemented, then it could contribute to stopping the spatial spread of disease between patches.},

abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a computational technique for approximate inference in state-space models. In typical applications, the state vectors are large spatial fields that are observed sequentially over time. The EnKF approximates the Kalman filter by representing the distribution of the state with an ensemble of draws from that distribution. The ensemble members are updated based on newly available data by shifting instead of reweighting, which allows the EnKF to avoid the degeneracy problems of reweighting-based algorithms. Taken together, the ensemble representation and shifting-based updates make the EnKF computationally feasible even for extremely high-dimensional state spaces. The EnKF is successfully used in data-assimilation applications with tens of millions of dimensions. While it implicitly assumes a linear Gaussian state-space model, it has also turned out to be remarkably robust to deviations from these assumptions in many applications. Despite its successes, the EnKF is largely unknown in the statistics community. We aim to change that with the present article, and to entice more statisticians to work on this topic.},

abstract = {Background: As lockdown measures to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection begin to ease in the UK, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in policy, including school reopening and broader relaxation of physical distancing measures. We aimed to use an individual-based model to predict the impact of two possible strategies for reopening schools to all students in the UK from September, 2020, in combination with different assumptions about relaxation of physical distancing measures and the scale-up of testing. Methods: In this modelling study, we used Covasim, a stochastic individual-based model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals' contact networks stratified into household, school, workplace, and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulated six different scenarios, representing the combination of two school reopening strategies (full time and a part-time rota system with 50{\%} of students attending school on alternate weeks) and three testing scenarios (68{\%} contact tracing with no scale-up in testing, 68{\%} contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave, and 40{\%} contact tracing with sufficient testing to avoid a second COVID-19 wave). We estimated the number of new infections, cases, and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number (R) under different strategies. In a sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated infectiousness of children and young adults aged younger than 20 years at 50{\%} relative to older ages (20 years and older). Findings: With increased levels of testing (between 59{\%} and 87{\%} of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, depending on the scenario), and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented. Assuming 68{\%} of contacts could be traced, we estimate that 75{\%} of individuals with symptomatic infection would need to be tested and positive cases isolated if schools return full-time in September, or 65{\%} if a part-time rota system were used. If only 40{\%} of contacts could be traced, these figures would increase to 87{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively. However, without these levels of testing and contact tracing, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a second wave that would peak in December, 2020, if schools open full-time in September, and in February, 2021, if a part-time rota system were adopted. In either case, the second wave would result in R rising above 1 and a resulting second wave of infections 2{\textperiodcentered}0–2{\textperiodcentered}3 times the size of the original COVID-19 wave. When infectiousness of children and young adults was varied from 100{\%} to 50{\%} of that of older ages, we still found that a comprehensive and effective test–trace–isolate strategy would be required to avoid a second COVID-19 wave. Interpretation: To prevent a second COVID-19 wave, relaxation of physical distancing, including reopening of schools, in the UK must be accompanied by large-scale, population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of diagnosed individuals.

@article{Espinoza2020,
abstract = {Background Mobility restrictions—trade and travel bans, border closures and, in extreme cases, area quarantines or cordons sanitaires—are among the most widely used measures to control infectious diseases. Restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 influenza (2009), Ebola (2014) and, currently in the containment of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, they do not always work as expected. Methods To determine when mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected communities. One community comprises a low-risk, low-density population with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a high-risk, high-density population without access to effective medical resources. Findings Unrestricted mobility between the two risk communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size. Interpretation Mobility restrictions may not be an effective policy for controlling the spread of an infectious disease if it is assessed by the overall final epidemic size. Patterns of mobility established through the independent mobility and trade decisions of people in both communities may be sufficient to contain epidemics.},

abstract = {Due to the recent evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts to analyse models for understanding the present situation and for predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a forced Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-RecoveredDead (fSEIRD) differential model for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile (Italian Civil Protection Department) from 24/02/2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of fSEIRD by proposing two different piecewise time-dependent infection rate functions to fit the current epidemic data affected by progressive movement restriction policies put in place by the Italian government. The proposed models are flexible and can be quickly adapted to monitor various epidemic scenarios. Results on the regions of Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna confirm that the proposed models fit the data very accurately and make reliable predictions.},

@article{Tseng2021,
abstract = {Background: The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been characterized as a worldwide pandemic. Currently, there are few preclinical animal models that suitably represent infection, as the main point of entry to human cells is via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is not present in typical preclinical mouse strains. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent and unsafe for use in many research facilities. Here we describe the development of a preclinical animal model using intranasal administration of ACE2 followed by non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) challenge. Methods: To specifically generate our SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we used a lentivirus system. Following co-transfection with a packaging plasmid containing HIV Gag and Pol, luciferase-expressing lentiviruses, and a plasmid carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 PsVs can be isolated and purified. To better understand and maximize the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we generated PsV carrying spike protein variants known to have varying human ACE2 binding properties, including 19 deletion (19del) and 19del + D614G. Results: Our system demonstrated the ability of PsVs to infect the respiratory passage of mice following intranasal hACE2 transduction. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo manipulability of our system using recombinant receptor-binding domain protein to prevent PsV infection. Conclusions: Our PsV system is able to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in a preclinical mouse model and can be used to test interventions or preventative treatments. We believe that this method can be extended to work in various mouse strains or to model infection with different coronaviruses. A simple in vivo system such as our model is crucial for rapidly and effectively responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in addition to preparing for future potential coronavirus outbreaks.},

abstract = {Modeling human behavior within mathematical models of infectious diseases is a key component to understand and control disease spread. We present a mathematical compartmental model of Susceptible–Infectious–Removed to compare the infected curves given by four different functional forms describing the transmission rate. These depend on the distance that individuals keep on average to others in their daily lives. We assume that this distance varies according to the balance between two opposite thrives: the self-protecting reaction of individuals upon the presence of disease to increase social distancing and their necessity to return to a culturally dependent natural social distance that occurs in the absence of disease. We present simulations to compare results for different society types on point prevalence, the peak size of a first epidemic outbreak and the time of occurrence of that peak, for four different transmission rate functional forms and parameters of interest related to distancing behavior, such as: the reaction velocity of a society to change social distance during an epidemic. We observe the vulnerability to disease spread of close contact societies, and also show that certain social distancing behavior may provoke a small peak of a first epidemic outbreak, but at the expense of it occurring early after the epidemic onset, observing differences in this regard between society types. We also discuss the appearance of temporal oscillations of the four different transmission rates, their differences, and how this oscillatory behavior is impacted through social distancing; breaking the unimodality of the actives-curve produced by the classical SIR-model.},

abstract = {1. Introducci{\'{o}}n Desde que se conoci{\'{o}} la existencia del Covid-19, el Gobierno ha liderado un conjunto de iniciativas para proteger a la poblaci{\'{o}}n, a trav{\'{e}}s del Plan de Acci{\'{o}}n Coronavirus, que involucra una gran cantidad de medidas, como el reforzamiento del sistema de salud, la creaci{\'{o}}n de m{\'{u}}ltiples instrumentos de apoyo a las familias, la instauraci{\'{o}}n de restricciones a las actividades y a la movilidad, el desarrollo de una estrategia de testeo, trazabilidad y aislamiento, entre muchas otros esfuerzos, que han impactado la vida de todos los chilenos. Las medidas se han ido incrementado en la medida que los riesgos sobre la poblaci{\'{o}}n se fueron incrementando. A nueve meses del primer caso de coronavirus en Chile, y despu{\'{e}}s de un gran esfuerzo de todos, podemos ver que las medidas de prevenci{\'{o}}n, autocuidado y operaci{\'{o}}n en Modo Covid surten efecto y generan una reducci{\'{o}}n gradual de las tasas de contagio. Si bien el avance es diverso en las distintas regiones y comunas del pa{\'{i}}s, en aquellas con mejor evoluci{\'{o}}n se pueden levantar algunas restricciones, para permitir recuperar la movilidad y el desarrollo de algunas actividades. Por ello, se estableci{\'{o}} una estrategia gradual de desconfinamiento, que sirve de marco en esta etapa y que permite entregar visibilidad y transparencia a la ciudadan{\'{i}}a respecto a lo que significa avanzar o retroceder y los pr{\'{o}}ximos pasos que iremos enfrentando. Durante todo este periodo de confinamiento hemos ido adapt{\'{a}}ndonos a nuevas costumbres y formas de realizar nuestras actividades habituales, lo que hacia adelante debe transformarse en un nuevo Modo Covid de vivir. El mundo post Covid no ser{\'{a}} igual que el anterior, al menos mientras no tengamos ampliamente disponible una vacuna o tratamiento, y por ello es fundamental tener una estrategia que nos ayude a vivir esta nueva realidad. El presente documento desarrolla las principales ideas de este plan maestro. 2. ¿En qu{\'{e}} consiste el confinamiento? En forma gradual, la Autoridad Sanitaria ha ido imponiendo restricciones para lograr reducir los riesgos de contagio en las diversas comunas del pa{\'{i}}s. Estas medidas se separan en dos grandes tipos: restricciones a actividades a nivel nacional y restricciones de movilidad a las personas, a nivel comunal. Las restricciones a las actividades a nivel nacional se tradujeron en restricciones sanitarias, algunas de responsabilidad personal para fomentar el autocuidado, y otras de restricci{\'{o}}n de funcionamiento de ciertas actividades espec{\'{i}}ficas. As{\'{i}}, promueven que vayamos adoptando en nuestra vida cotidiana el distanciamiento f{\'{i}}sico, la higiene permanente y el autocuidado, y que vayamos reduciendo las instancias o actividades que conllevan mayor riesgo de contagio, particularmente actividades en las que las personas se re{\'{u}}nen en espacios cerrados. Las restricciones a la movilidad en comunas o territorios en las que la pandemia ha generado brotes masivos, consisten en la instauraci{\'{o}}n de cuarentenas y cordones sanitarios. La cuarentena es la restricci{\'{o}}n m{\'{a}}s estricta, ya que limita la movilidad a las personas, permitiendo salir del domicilio s{\'{o}}lo a las actividades esenciales espec{\'{i}}ficamente autorizadas. Esta medida se impone para reducir al m{\'{i}}nimo la interacci{\'{o}}n entre personas y las actividades en las que se produce mayormente el contagio. Por su parte, los cordones sanitarios son barreras que impiden a la poblaci{\'{o}}n ingresar o salir de un determinado per{\'{i}}metro geogr{\'{a}}fico, permitiendo traspasarlo solo bajo condiciones especiales.},

abstract = {The quantification of transmissibility during epidemics is essential to designing and adjusting public health responses. Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature. This tool should help epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.},

abstract = {Pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has affected to world in several aspects: high number of confirmed cases, high number of deaths, low economic growth, among others. Understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of the virus is helpful and necessary for decision making, for instance to decide where, whether and how, non-pharmaceutical intervention policies are to be applied. This point has not been properly addressed in literature since typical strategies do not consider marked differences on the epidemic spread across country or large territory. Those strategies assume similarities and apply similar interventions instead. This work is focused on posing a methodology where spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics is captured by means of dividing a territory in time-varying epidemic regions, according to geographical closeness and infection level. In addition, a novel Lagrangian-SEIR-based model is posed for describing the dynamic within and between those regions. The capabilities of this methodology for identifying local outbreaks and reproducing the epidemic curve are discussed for the case of COVID-19 epidemic in Jalisco state (Mexico). The contagions from July 31, 2020 to March 31, 2021 are analyzed, with monthly adjustments, and the estimates obtained at the level of the epidemic regions present satisfactory results since Relative Root Mean Squared Error RRMSE is below 15{\%} in most of regions, and at the level of the whole state outstanding with RRMSE below 5{\%}.},

abstract = {We present modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Illinois, USA, capturing the implementation of a stay-at-home order and scenarios for its eventual release. We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long and variable time delays without changing its model topology. Bayesian estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19 patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its subregions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and density. Without prior information on nonpharmaceutical interventions, the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting the regional-dependent results of releasing stay-at-home orders. The resulting highly constrained narrative of the epidemic is able to provide estimates of its unseen progression and inform scenarios for sustainable monitoring and control of the epidemic.},

The first sample was 267 children, 90 girls (34{\%}) and 177 (66{\%}) boys from Oriental Andalusia, aged between 8 and 10 years old. After four years, we analysed the same children with permanent teething and we obtained just a sample of 171, 69 girls (40{\%}) and 102 (60{\%}) boys, with an average age of 12 years and a range from 11 to 13 years, using as criteria selection not having morphological alteration, teeth loss, important congestions, between other elements. The teething dimension was measured as the maximum distance between the mesiodistal contact points of the crown, using a sharp-end gauge, with a 0,1 mm precision. Al! the measurements were made by the same viewer, directly to the mouth. For the statistic analysis was used the t Student test, with a level of statistic signification of p{\textless}0,05.},

Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in quantifying indicators describing diverse aspects of the pandemic. Consequently, this work aims to develop a clear, efficient, and reproducible methodology for parameter optimization, whose implementation is illustrated using data from three representative regions from Chile and a suitable generalized SIR model together with a fitted positivity rate. Our results reproduce the general trend of the infected's curve, distinguishing the reported and real cases.

abstract = {In this study, the transmissibility estimation of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been presented using the generalized fractional-order calculus (FOC) based extended Kalman filter (EKF) and wavelet transform (WT) methods. Initially, the state-space representation for the bats-hosts-reservoir-people (BHRP) model is obtained using a set of fractional order differential equations for the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. Afterward, the EKF and Kronecker product based WT methods have been applied to the discrete vector representation of the BHRP model. The main advantage of using EKF in this system is that it considers both the process and the measurement noise, which gives better accuracy and probable states, which are the Markovian (processes). The importance of proposed models lies in the fact that these models can accommodate conventional EKF and WT methods as their special cases. Further, we have compared the estimated number of contagious people and recovered people with the actual number of infectious people and recovered people in India and China.},

abstract = {The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound, and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures-so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)-aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission. Two fundamental strategies are possible: (a) mitigation, which focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread-reducing peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection, and (b) suppression, which aims to reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely. Each policy has major challenges. We find that that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease) might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half. However, the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. For countries able to achieve it, this leaves suppression as the preferred policy option. We show that in the UK and US context, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures, though it should be recognised that such closures may have negative impacts on health systems due to increased},

"Transmission events occur through contacts made between susceptible and infectious individuals in either the household, workplace, school or randomly in the community, with the latter depending on spatial distance between contacts. Per-capita contacts within schools were assumed to be double those elsewhere in order to reproduce the attack rates in children observed in past influenza pandemics7. With the parameterisation above, approximately one third of transmission occurs in the household, one third in schools and workplaces and the remaining third in the community. These contact patterns reproduce those reported in social mixing surveys [8]" [p.4]

abstract = {Against the current COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide have devised a variety of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate it. However, it is generally difficult to estimate the joint impact of different control strategies. In this paper, we tackle this question with an extended epidemic SEIR model, informed by a socio-political classification of different interventions. First, we inquire the conceptual effect of mitigation parameters on the infection curve. Then, we illustrate the potential of our model to reproduce and explain empirical data from a number of countries, to perform cross-country comparisons. This gives information on the best synergies of interventions to control epidemic outbreaks while minimising impact on socio-economic needs. For instance, our results suggest that, while rapid and strong lockdown is an effective pandemic mitigation measure, a combination of social distancing and early contact tracing can achieve similar mitigation synergistically, while keeping lower isolation rates. This quantitative understanding can support the establishment of mid- and long-term interventions, to prepare containment strategies against further outbreaks. This paper also provides an online tool that allows researchers and decision makers to interactively simulate diverse scenarios with our model.},

abstract = {The Kalman filter is the minimum-variance state estimator for linear dynamic systems with Gaussian noise. Even if the noise is non-Gaussian, the Kalman filter is the best linear estimator. For nonlinear systems it is not possible, in general, to derive the optimal state estimator in closed form, but various modifications of the Kalman filter can be used to estimate the state. These modifications include the extended Kalman filter, the unscented Kalman filter, and the particle filter. Although the Kalman filter and its modifications are powerful tools for state estimation, we might have information about a system that the Kalman filter does not incorporate. For example, we may know that the states satisfy equality or inequality constraints. In this case we can modify the Kalman filter to exploit this additional information and get better filtering performance than the Kalman filter provides. This paper provides an overview of various ways to incorporate state constraints in the Kalman filter and its nonlinear modifications. If both the system and state constraints are linear, then all of these different approaches result in the same state estimate, which is the optimal constrained linear state estimate. If either the system or constraints are nonlinear, then constrained filtering is, in general, not optimal, and different approaches give different results. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

Our findings suggest that social distancing and quarantine are the winning strategies to reduce the impact of the outbreak.

The researchers combined data from Tencent, one of the world's largest social media and technology companies, with a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference to analyze early spread within China. They estimate that ∼86{\%} of cases were undocumented before travel restrictions were put in place. Before travel restriction and personal isolation were implemented, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was a little more than half that of the known cases. However, because of their greater numbers, undocumented infections were the source for ∼80{\%} of the documented cases. Immediately after travel restrictions were imposed, ∼65{\%} of cases were documented. These findings help to explain the lightning-fast spread of this virus around the world.},

abstract = {A pandemic of a novel Coronavirus emerged in December of 2019 (COVID-19), causing devastating public health impact across the world. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by ℛc), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80{\%} and 64{\%}, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy ≥ 70{\%}) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70{\%} of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80{\%} will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30{\%}), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.},

We parameterised the model using published data on the transmission rates and progression dynamics of COVID-19, and demographic and spatial data from Europe's largest refugee camp, the Moria displacement camp on Lesbos, Greece. We simulated COVID-19 epidemics with and without four feasible interventions. Results Spatial subdivision of the camp sectoring') was able to flatten the curve', reducing peak infection by up to 70{\%} and delaying peak infection by up to several months. The use of face masks coupled with the efficient isolation of infected individuals reduced the overall incidence of infection, and sometimes averted epidemics altogether. These interventions must be implemented quickly in order to be maximally effective. Lockdowns had only small effects on COVID-19 dynamics. Conclusions Agent-based models are powerful tools for forecasting the spread of disease in spatially structured and heterogeneous populations. Our findings suggest that feasible interventions can slow the spread of COVID-19 in a refugee camp setting, and provide an evidence base for camp managers planning intervention strategies. Our model can be modified to study other closed populations at risk from COVID-19 or future epidemics.},

abstract = {Background Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. Methods and Findings 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5-to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. Conclusions To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

@article{DeVisscher2020,
abstract = {An epidemiological model for COVID-19 was developed and implemented in MATLAB/GNU Octave for use by public health practitioners, policy makers, and the general public. The model distinguishes four stages in the disease: infected, sick, seriously sick, and better. The model was preliminarily parameterized based on observations of the spread of the disease. The model assumes a case mortality rate of 1.5{\%}. Preliminary simulations with the model indicate that concepts such as “herd immunity” and containment (“flattening the curve”) are highly misleading in the context of this virus. Public policies based on these concepts are inadequate to protect the population. Only reducing the R0 of the virus below 1 is an effective strategy for maintaining the death burden of COVID-19 within the normal range of seasonal flu. The model is illustrated with the cases of Italy, France, and Iran and is able to describe the number of deaths as a function of time in all these cases although future projections tend to slightly overestimate the number of deaths when the analysis is made early on. The model can also be used to describe reopenings of the economy after a lockdown. The case mortality rate is still prone to large uncertainty, but modeling combined with an investigation of blood donations in The Netherlands imposes a lower limit of 1{\%}.},

abstract = {In this paper, an Ensemble of Kalman filter (EnKf) approach is developed to estimate unmeasurable state variables and unknown parameters in a COVID-19 model. We first formulate a mathematical model for the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 that takes into account the circulation of free coronaviruses in the environment. We provide the basic properties of the model and compute the basic reproduction number R0 that plays an important role in the outcome of the disease. After, assuming continuous measurement of newly COVID-19 reported cases, deceased and recovered individuals, the EnKf approach is used to estimate the unmeasured variables and unknown COVID-19 transmission rates using real data of the current COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon. We present the forecasts of the current pandemic in Cameroon and explore the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mass media-based sensitization, social distancing, face-mask wearing, contact tracing and the desinfection and decontamination of infected places by using suitable products against free coronaviruses in the environment in order to reduce the spread of the disease. Through numerical simulations, we find that at that time (i) R0≈2.9495 meaning that the disease will not die out without any control measures, (ii) the infection from COVID-19 infected cases is more important than the infection from free coronaviruses in the environment, (iii) the number of new COVID-19 cases will still increase and there is a necessity to increase timely the surveillance by using contact tracing and sensibilisation of the population to respect social distancing, face-masks wearing through awareness programs and (iv) the eradication of the pandemic is highly dependent on the control measures taken by governments.},

abstract = {Objective To compare the inference regarding the effectiveness of the various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for COVID-19 obtained from different SIR models. Study design and setting We explored two models developed by Imperial College that considered only NPIs without accounting for mobility (model 1) or only mobility (model 2), and a model accounting for the combination of mobility and NPIs (model 3). Imperial College applied models 1 and 2 to 11 European countries and to the USA, respectively. We applied these models to 14 European countries (original 11 plus another 3), over two different time horizons. Results While model 1 found that lockdown was the most effective measure in the original 11 countries, model 2 showed that lockdown had little or no benefit as it was typically introduced at a point when the time-varying reproductive number was already very low. Model 3 found that the simple banning of public events was beneficial, while lockdown had no consistent impact. Based on Bayesian metrics, model 2 was better supported by the data than either model 1 or model 3 for both time horizons. Conclusions Inferences on effects of NPIs are non-robust and highly sensitive to model specification. Claimed benefits of lockdown appear grossly exaggerated. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement No funding {\#}{\#}{\#} Author Declarations I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

abstract = {The Effective Reproduction Number Rt provides essential information for the management of an epidemic/pandemic. Projecting Rt into the future could further assist in the management process. This article proposes a methodology based on exposure scenarios to perform such a procedure. The method utilizes a compartmental model and its adequate parametrization; a way to determine suitable parameters for this model in M{\'{e}}xico's case is detailed. In conjunction with the compartmental model, the projection of Rt permits estimating unobserved variables, such as the size of the asymptomatic population, and projecting into the future other relevant variables, like the active hospitalizations, using scenarios. The uses of the proposed methodologies are exemplified by analyzing the pandemic in a Mexican state; the main quantities derived from the compartmental model, such as the active and total cases, are included in the analysis. This article also presents a national summary based on the methodologies to illustrate how these procedures could be further exploited. The supporting information includes an application of the proposed methods to a metropolitan area to show that it also works well at other demographic disaggregation levels. The procedures developed in this article shed light on how to develop an effective surveillance system when information is incomplete and can be applied in cases other than M{\'{e}}xico's.},

"Simple compartmentalized epidemiological models have proven their usefulness for different infectious agents. Nevertheless, to model an infectious process at a regional or global level, it is important to consider the structure ofsubpopulations and their heterogeneous relations because, frequently, they are induced by the spatial structure and the associated mobility [1–4]" [p. 1]

"Other works extend compartmental models to heterogeneous populations introducing compartments and parameters, for each subpopulation, that can describe the within and between contacts. These types ofmodels, also known as patch models, have been studied in works such as [2, 13, 14]. Their findings shed light on the heterogeneity/mobility impact on the resulting R0, Rt, but due to the large number ofparameters usually involved, even for mod- erate numbers ofsubpopulations, performing statistical inference is prohibitive."[p.2]

abstract = {The global outbreak of COVID-19 requires us to accurately predict the spread of disease and decide how adopting corresponding strategies to ensure the sustainable development. Most of the existing infectious disease forecasting methods are based on the classical Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. However, due to the highly nonlinearity, nonstationarity, sensitivities to initial values and parameters, SIR type models would produce large deviations in the forecast results. Here, we propose a framework of using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate the model parameters, and then the data assimilation based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter to update model trajectory by cooperating with the real time confirmed cases, so as to improve the predictability of the pandemic. Based on this framework, we have developed a global COVID-19 real time forecasting system. Moreover, we suggest that big data associated with the spatiotemporally heterogeneous pathological characteristics, and social environment in different countries should be assimilated to further improve the COVID-19 predictability. It is hoped that the accurate prediction of COVID-19 will contribute to the adjustments of prevention and control strategies to contain the pandemic, and help achieve the SDG goal of “Good Health and Well-Being”.},

It begins with an historical outline of some disease statistics dating from Daniel Bernoulli's smallpox data of 1760. The authors then describe simple deterministic and stochastic models in continuous and discrete time for epidemics taking place in either homogeneous or stratified (non-homogeneous) populations. A range of techniques for constructing and analysing models is provided, mostly in the context of viral and bacterial diseases of human populations. These models are contrasted with models for rumours and vector-borne diseases like malaria. Questions of fitting data to models, and the use of models to understand methods for controlling the spread of infection are discussed. Exercises and complementary results at the end of each chapter extend the scope of the text, which will be useful for students taking courses in mathematical biology who have some basic knowledge of probability and statistics.},
